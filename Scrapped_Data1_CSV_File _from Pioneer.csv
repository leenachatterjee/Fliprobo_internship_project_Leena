Mashal Yatra evokes huge response across State,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",PNS,"Pressing for implementation of the Odisha Official language Act, 1954 for using Odia in all official works, the Bhasa Suraksha Sammilani on Madhu Jayanti held a Mashal Yatra all over the State.
The Yatra was a huge success as people from various walks of life joined, said Sammilani president and Rajya Sabha member Baishnab Parida.
In a bid to protect and promote the Odia language, the Bhasa Suraksha Sammilani observed the birth anniversary of Utkal Gaurav Madhusudan Das.
In spite of several promises given by the Government, the language Act is not being implemented, Parida alleged.
Though Odia has been given classical language status by the Centre, it is being neglected in its own land, he rued. 
leaders across party line, institutions, literary and cultural organisations, writers, intellectuals and students participated in the procession in the city.
Parida said the Government must pass an order for introduction of Odia in Government offices, courts, educational institutions and business establishments.

Young singers enthral audience despite congenital disorders,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",PNS,"Sheer determination and lots of perseverance will certainly turn the adversities into achievements. This is perhaps turning out to be true for 10-year-old Keonjhar boy Premranjan Moharana and a 12-year-old Bhubaneswar girl Subhashree Swain.
Born with double deformity of cleft lip and cleft palate, Premranjan and Subhashree are now not only speaking fluently after two successful surgical corrections each but are emerging as amazing singers.
A first-year student of Sangeet Visarad, Premranjan is waiting for the results of the AIR audition and the Indian Idol audition for the current season. Having performed in over a hundred stage shows, he is an acclaimed performer of local music TV channels.
Subhashree too, after coming under the scalpel when she was only three-month-old to correct her cleft lip and a rigorous cleft palate surgery when she was nine-month-old, is now the darling of music channels, undeterred with her misaligned jaws and the buck tooth.
Both the singing sensations with their renditions on Sunday last enthralled a crowd of over a hundred children, who had undergone paediatric plastic surgery to correct their congenital abnormalities at the SBM Plastic Surgery Hospital Pvt ltd. here at Balikuda under the supervision of plastic surgeon Bibhuti Bhusan Nayak.
A trendsetter in micro-vascular surgeries in Odisha, 48-year-old Nayak claims to have so far performed over 5,000 cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries.
“Proper palatal repair at appropriate time and correct post-operative managements will rectify all speech problems, and these special children will definitely chase their dreams to be good orators or even singers,” Dr Nayak says.
Cleft lip surgery at the age of three months and cleft palate surgery at the age of nine months are said to be ideal, Nayak says, adding that most parents fail to identify the soft palate deformity of their children at this age, leading to major complications as they grow up.
“With support from the Smile Train programme, our hospital has already performed nearly 350 lip and palate surgical corrections free of cost in the past one year by not only bringing smile to these children but restoring smiles on the faces of their parents,” Dr Nayak said."
Rotavirus claims 40% diarrhoea deaths of Indian kids,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",ARABINDA MOHANTY,"As a doctor and researcher, I’ve seen that rotavirus is the most common cause of deadly dehydrating diarrhoea and infected infants and young children suffer a lot. It is extremely contagious and strikes nearly every child when they are young. Hence, preventing it must be priority.
Babies and young children can be protected from it and treated when they become sick, but for many the care they need is out of reach. Rotavirus accounts for about 40 per cent of India’s diarrhoea-related deaths. In 2011, rotavirus diarrhoea claimed the lives of more than 75,000 children under age five and resulted in more than 8.5 lakh hospitalisations and 30 lakh outpatient visits. That’s an alarming number of mothers and fathers anxiously waiting at their sick children’s bedside.
Diarrhoea in general and rotavirus in particular, places a heavy burden on families, communities and the nation. Hospitalisation for a child with rotavirus costs between `2,000 and `8,400 per episode. What’s more, rotavirus diarrhoea-related medical expenses cost India approximately `500 crore each year, tremendously straining our already overstretched State healthcare system.
The impact of a diarrhoea hospitalisation extends beyond the medical costs incurred by the family. It extends to loss of wages, when parents have to stay home or travel to a health clinic to tend to their sick children, leading to the family facing a grave economic situation. Protecting children from rotavirus in the first place is extremely critical.
The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in four States in the first phase, and other vaccines including the expansion of pentavalent vaccine across the country, is one of the most significant Government health initiatives in the past few years. The existing body of research on the rotavirus vaccine is robust, demonstrating that they provide broad protection against severe rotavirus, even against strains not included in the vaccine.
Moreover, these vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the number of diarrhoea-related illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths among children in the countries where they are in use.
With the vaccine included in the national immunisation programme, we can now prevent tens of thousands of deaths, not to mention the huge number of hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Not only would it have a positive social and economic impact, this also means we are moving towards ensuring equitable access for all children thereby protecting their right to survival, good health and development. India is well on track towards its commitment to adopting the Integrated Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) interventions.
As a healer of children, I can now proudly say that this move has, in a way, answered the prayers of paediatricians across the country. I sincerely believe that now we can reduce the diarrhoea burden among children in the country, improve our health indicators at the global platform and give our children a better chance at life.

This is perhaps turning out to be true for 10-year-old Keonjhar boy Premranjan Moharana and a 12-year-old Bhubaneswar girl Subhashree Swain.
Born with double deformity of cleft lip and cleft palate, Premranjan and Subhashree are now not only speaking fluently after two successful surgical corrections each but are emerging as amazing singers.
A first-year student of Sangeet Visarad, Premranjan is waiting for the results of the AIR audition and the Indian Idol audition for the current season. Having performed in over a hundred stage shows, he is an acclaimed performer of local music TV channels.
Subhashree too, after coming under the scalpel when she was only three-month-old to correct her cleft lip and a rigorous cleft palate surgery when she was nine-month-old, is now the darling of music channels, undeterred with her misaligned jaws and the buck tooth.
Both the singing sensations with their renditions on Sunday last enthralled a crowd of over a hundred children, who had undergone paediatric plastic surgery to correct their congenital abnormalities at the SBM Plastic Surgery Hospital Pvt ltd. here at Balikuda under the supervision of plastic surgeon Bibhuti Bhusan Nayak.
A trendsetter in micro-vascular surgeries in Odisha, 48-year-old Nayak claims to have so far performed over 5,000 cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries.
“Proper palatal repair at appropriate time and correct post-operative managements will rectify all speech problems, and these special children will definitely chase their dreams to be good orators or even singers,” Dr Nayak says.
Cleft lip surgery at the age of three months and cleft palate surgery at the age of nine months are said to be ideal, Nayak says, adding that most parents fail to identify the soft palate deformity of their children at this age, leading to major complications as they grow up.
“With support from the Smile Train programme, our hospital has already performed nearly 350 lip and palate surgical corrections free of cost in the past one year by not only bringing smile to these children but restoring smiles on the faces of their parents,” Dr Nayak said."
Rotavirus claims 40% diarrhoea deaths of Indian kids,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",ARABINDA MOHANTY,"As a doctor and researcher, I’ve seen that rotavirus is the most common cause of deadly dehydrating diarrhoea and infected infants and young children suffer a lot. It is extremely contagious and strikes nearly every child when they are young. Hence, preventing it must be priority.
Babies and young children can be protected from it and treated when they become sick, but for many the care they need is out of reach. Rotavirus accounts for about 40 per cent of India’s diarrhoea-related deaths. In 2011, rotavirus diarrhoea claimed the lives of more than 75,000 children under age five and resulted in more than 8.5 lakh hospitalisations and 30 lakh outpatient visits. That’s an alarming number of mothers and fathers anxiously waiting at their sick children’s bedside.
Diarrhoea in general and rotavirus in particular, places a heavy burden on families, communities and the nation. Hospitalisation for a child with rotavirus costs between `2,000 and `8,400 per episode. What’s more, rotavirus diarrhoea-related medical expenses cost India approximately `500 crore each year, tremendously straining our already overstretched State healthcare system.
The impact of a diarrhoea hospitalisation extends beyond the medical costs incurred by the family. It extends to loss of wages, when parents have to stay home or travel to a health clinic to tend to their sick children, leading to the family facing a grave economic situation. Protecting children from rotavirus in the first place is extremely critical.
The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in four States in the first phase, and other vaccines including the expansion of pentavalent vaccine across the country, is one of the most significant Government health initiatives in the past few years. The existing body of research on the rotavirus vaccine is robust, demonstrating that they provide broad protection against severe rotavirus, even against strains not included in the vaccine.
Moreover, these vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the number of diarrhoea-related illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths among children in the countries where they are in use.
With the vaccine included in the national immunisation programme, we can now prevent tens of thousands of deaths, not to mention the huge number of hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Not only would it have a positive social and economic impact, this also means we are moving towards ensuring equitable access for all children thereby protecting their right to survival, good health and development. India is well on track towards its commitment to adopting the Integrated Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) interventions.
As a healer of children, I can now proudly say that this move has, in a way, answered the prayers of paediatricians across the country. I sincerely believe that now we can reduce the diarrhoea burden among children in the country, improve our health indicators at the global platform and give our children a better chance at life.

A trendsetter in micro-vascular surgeries in Odisha, 48-year-old Nayak claims to have so far performed over 5,000 cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries.
“Proper palatal repair at appropriate time and correct post-operative managements will rectify all speech problems, and these special children will definitely chase their dreams to be good orators or even singers,” Dr Nayak says.
Cleft lip surgery at the age of three months and cleft palate surgery at the age of nine months are said to be ideal, Nayak says, adding that most parents fail to identify the soft palate deformity of their children at this age, leading to major complications as they grow up.
“With support from the Smile Train programme, our hospital has already performed nearly 350 lip and palate surgical corrections free of cost in the past one year by not only bringing smile to these children but restoring smiles on the faces of their parents,” Dr Nayak said."
Rotavirus claims 40% diarrhoea deaths of Indian kids,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",ARABINDA MOHANTY,"As a doctor and researcher, I’ve seen that rotavirus is the most common cause of deadly dehydrating diarrhoea and infected infants and young children suffer a lot. It is extremely contagious and strikes nearly every child when they are young. Hence, preventing it must be priority.
Babies and young children can be protected from it and treated when they become sick, but for many the care they need is out of reach. Rotavirus accounts for about 40 per cent of India’s diarrhoea-related deaths. In 2011, rotavirus diarrhoea claimed the lives of more than 75,000 children under age five and resulted in more than 8.5 lakh hospitalisations and 30 lakh outpatient visits. That’s an alarming number of mothers and fathers anxiously waiting at their sick children’s bedside.
Diarrhoea in general and rotavirus in particular, places a heavy burden on families, communities and the nation. Hospitalisation for a child with rotavirus costs between `2,000 and `8,400 per episode. What’s more, rotavirus diarrhoea-related medical expenses cost India approximately `500 crore each year, tremendously straining our already overstretched State healthcare system.
The impact of a diarrhoea hospitalisation extends beyond the medical costs incurred by the family. It extends to loss of wages, when parents have to stay home or travel to a health clinic to tend to their sick children, leading to the family facing a grave economic situation. Protecting children from rotavirus in the first place is extremely critical.
The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in four States in the first phase, and other vaccines including the expansion of pentavalent vaccine across the country, is one of the most significant Government health initiatives in the past few years. The existing body of research on the rotavirus vaccine is robust, demonstrating that they provide broad protection against severe rotavirus, even against strains not included in the vaccine.
Moreover, these vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the number of diarrhoea-related illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths among children in the countries where they are in use.
With the vaccine included in the national immunisation programme, we can now prevent tens of thousands of deaths, not to mention the huge number of hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Not only would it have a positive social and economic impact, this also means we are moving towards ensuring equitable access for all children thereby protecting their right to survival, good health and development. India is well on track towards its commitment to adopting the Integrated Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) interventions.
As a healer of children, I can now proudly say that this move has, in a way, answered the prayers of paediatricians across the country. I sincerely believe that now we can reduce the diarrhoea burden among children in the country, improve our health indicators at the global platform and give our children a better chance at life.

Rotavirus claims 40% diarrhoea deaths of Indian kids,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",ARABINDA MOHANTY,"As a doctor and researcher, I’ve seen that rotavirus is the most common cause of deadly dehydrating diarrhoea and infected infants and young children suffer a lot. It is extremely contagious and strikes nearly every child when they are young. Hence, preventing it must be priority.
Babies and young children can be protected from it and treated when they become sick, but for many the care they need is out of reach. Rotavirus accounts for about 40 per cent of India’s diarrhoea-related deaths. In 2011, rotavirus diarrhoea claimed the lives of more than 75,000 children under age five and resulted in more than 8.5 lakh hospitalisations and 30 lakh outpatient visits. That’s an alarming number of mothers and fathers anxiously waiting at their sick children’s bedside.
Diarrhoea in general and rotavirus in particular, places a heavy burden on families, communities and the nation. Hospitalisation for a child with rotavirus costs between `2,000 and `8,400 per episode. What’s more, rotavirus diarrhoea-related medical expenses cost India approximately `500 crore each year, tremendously straining our already overstretched State healthcare system.
The impact of a diarrhoea hospitalisation extends beyond the medical costs incurred by the family. It extends to loss of wages, when parents have to stay home or travel to a health clinic to tend to their sick children, leading to the family facing a grave economic situation. Protecting children from rotavirus in the first place is extremely critical.
The introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in four States in the first phase, and other vaccines including the expansion of pentavalent vaccine across the country, is one of the most significant Government health initiatives in the past few years. The existing body of research on the rotavirus vaccine is robust, demonstrating that they provide broad protection against severe rotavirus, even against strains not included in the vaccine.
Moreover, these vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce the number of diarrhoea-related illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths among children in the countries where they are in use.
With the vaccine included in the national immunisation programme, we can now prevent tens of thousands of deaths, not to mention the huge number of hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Not only would it have a positive social and economic impact, this also means we are moving towards ensuring equitable access for all children thereby protecting their right to survival, good health and development. India is well on track towards its commitment to adopting the Integrated Global Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) interventions.
As a healer of children, I can now proudly say that this move has, in a way, answered the prayers of paediatricians across the country. I sincerely believe that now we can reduce the diarrhoea burden among children in the country, improve our health indicators at the global platform and give our children a better chance at life.

Young singers enthral audience despite congenital disorders,"Saturday, 30 April 2016",PNS,"Sheer determination and lots of perseverance will certainly turn the adversities into achievements. This is perhaps turning out to be true for 10-year-old Keonjhar boy Premranjan Moharana and a 12-year-old Bhubaneswar girl Subhashree Swain.
Born with double deformity of cleft lip and cleft palate, Premranjan and Subhashree are now not only speaking fluently after two successful surgical corrections each but are emerging as amazing singers.
A first-year student of Sangeet Visarad, Premranjan is waiting for the results of the AIR audition and the Indian Idol audition for the current season. Having performed in over a hundred stage shows, he is an acclaimed performer of local music TV channels.
Subhashree too, after coming under the scalpel when she was only three-month-old to correct her cleft lip and a rigorous cleft palate surgery when she was nine-month-old, is now the darling of music channels, undeterred with her misaligned jaws and the buck tooth.
Both the singing sensations with their renditions on Sunday last enthralled a crowd of over a hundred children, who had undergone paediatric plastic surgery to correct their congenital abnormalities at the SBM Plastic Surgery Hospital Pvt ltd. here at Balikuda under the supervision of plastic surgeon Bibhuti Bhusan Nayak.
A trendsetter in micro-vascular surgeries in Odisha, 48-year-old Nayak claims to have so far performed over 5,000 cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries.
“Proper palatal repair at appropriate time and correct post-operative managements will rectify all speech problems, and these special children will definitely chase their dreams to be good orators or even singers,” Dr Nayak says.
