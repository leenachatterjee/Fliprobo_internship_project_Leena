The magnitude and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic in India surging,” Biden said, adding that India accounts for over one-third of new global cases.\\n\\nThe number of new cases in India is accelerating at a rapid rate, he said. Biden said there have been more than 300,000 average new daily cases in India over the past week.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the public health situation within India, the CDC has concluded that proactive measures are required to protect the nation\\'s public health from travellers entering the United States from that jurisdiction, he said.\\n\\n“There is no question that it is a great tragedy, in terms of the loss of life, and as I have said before, and I will say again, we as a country have made a commitment to the people of India to support them,” Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters on Friday in Cincinnati, Ohio.\\n\\nAccording to the State Department, the travel ban exemption to certain categories is in line with a similar exemption that the US has granted to some categories of travellers from Brazil, China, Iran and or South Africa.\\n\\n“In keeping with the Department of State\\'s commitment to facilitate legitimate travel to the United States, Secretary (Antony) Blinken decided today to apply the same set of National Interest Exceptions to India that he had previously applied to all other regional travel restrictions currently in effect as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the State Department said.\\n\\nStudents seeking to commence studies in the fall, academics, journalists and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by a geographic COVID-19 restriction may qualify for the exception, it said.\\n\\nThis includes qualified applicants who have been present in India, Brazil, China, Iran, or South Africa, it added.\\n\\nThe pandemic continues to limit the number of visas our embassies and consulates abroad are able to process, it said.\\n\\nAs always, visa applicants should check the website of the nearest embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date information about visa appointment availability, the State Department said.\\n\\n“As the global situation evolves, the Department continues to seek ways to process more visa applications, in line with science-based guidance from health authorities and with the health and safety of staff and applicants as our priority,” it said.\\n\\nIn a national interest exemption issued by the State Department on April 26, which it said is good for India too, students with valid F-1 and M-1 visas intending to begin or continue an academic programme commencing August 1 or later do not need to contact an embassy or consulate to seek an individual exemption to travel.\\n\\nThey may enter the United States no earlier than 30 days before the start of their academic studies.\\n\\nStudents seeking to apply for new F-1 or M-1 visas should check the status of visa services at the nearest embassy or consulate.\\n\\nThose applicants who are found to be otherwise qualified for an F-1 or M-1 visa will automatically be considered for an NIE to travel, it said.\\n\\nThe Department of State also continues to grant NIEs for qualified travellers seeking to enter the US for purposes related to humanitarian travel, public health response and national security.\\n\\nThese travellers and any others who believe their travel to be in the United States\\' national interest should also review the website of the nearest US embassy or consulate for instruction on how to contact them, it said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the US embassy in New Delhi said: \"We encourage US citizens who wish to depart India to take advantage of currently available commercial flights.\\n\\n\"Airlines continue to operate dozens of direct flights weekly from India to the United States. Additional flight options remain available via transfers in Paris, Frankfurt, and Doha,\" it said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Republican lawmakers criticised President Biden for imposing restrictions on travel from India.\\n\\n“Restricting travel to our ally India while leaving our border open to Mexico is not rational,” Congressman Tim Burchett said in a tweet, soon after the White House announced Biden\\'s decision.\\n\\nAnother Republican lawmaker Jodey Arrington also criticised Biden for this proclamation on travel.\\n\\n“Biden enacting an India travel ban while keeping the border open is like locking your front door, but leaving the back door wide open. I wonder if the Left will accuse him of being xenophobic and anti-Hindu,” Arrington asked.\\n\\n“As Biden bans flights from India, perhaps he should be reminded of a tweet he put out last year. Also, I thought travel bans were xenophobic,” Congresswoman Lauren Boebert said in a tweet.\\n\\nAfter former president Donald Trump imposed a travel ban from Europe, Biden, who was the Democratic presidential candidate at that time, had opposed it.\\n\\nIn Video: Covid-19 surge: Travel from India to US to be restricted from May 4\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nU.S.CovidWhite HouseCenters For Disease Control And PreventionJoe BidenJen Psaki\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n21 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRaj Sharlan\\n118 days ago\\nGood step now apply restriction selectively..

The contents of these letters have garnered attention as it is invariance to the claims made by the government and chief minister that there is no shortage of beds, oxygen, etc.\\n\\n“It is the top priority of everyone that things improve and such correspondence is not aimed at incriminating anyone. It is only meant to better the current facilities. At this time, both the ruling party and opposition should rise above the blame game and highlight the lack of facilities,” BJP’s UP spokesperson Hero Vajpayee reasoned when asked about the communication.\\n\\nOn Thursday, BJP MLA from Gola in Lakhimpur Khiri, Arvind Giri, shot off a letter to the District Magistrate (DM), stating that “more than two dozen” of his acquaintances, along with “hundreds of people” have died due to oxygen shortage and asked for more beds and medical care facilities to be provided to the constituency.\\n\\nSpeaking to ET, Giri said, “People were crying for oxygen and I could not help them. I kept requesting the DM, but to no avail. What the CM is doing for the state is unmatched by any other CM. He has put in a system after a lot of effort, but the administration on the ground has ruined it. District administrations are proving to be a failure”.\\n\\nHe said that after his communication, the tehsil administration has pulled up its socks and efforts are on now to bring the oxygen situation under control in the next couple of days, at least in Gola.\\n\\nLaw minister Brijesh Pathak was the first one to direct the state administration’s attention to the failing situation in Lucknow in terms of lack of bed and delays in medical care.\\n\\nBJP MP from Mohanlalganj Kaushal Kishore is also increasingly vocal about the on-ground chaos –– from highlighting how oxygen suppliers were not being supplied to private hospitals to directing the CM’s attention towards laxities being observed by prominent government hospitals in Lucknow to requesting the to postpone the panchayat elections that have allegedly claimed the lives of more than 700 teachers who were on duty.\\n\\nSimilarly, Meerut MP, Rajendra Agarwal had written to the CM about the glaring shortage of oxygen in the district which was preventing hospitals to accept new patients.\\n\\nEarlier this week, BJP MLA from Aurai, Bhadohi, Dinanath Bhaskar, wrote a letter to the CM calling for a probe into the Covid-related death of the BJP district secretary of Bhadohi. The leader passed away on April 27 in a government hospital in Bhadohi. The MLA said he was informed by the leader’s children that despite desperate appeals, their father was neither administered , nor taken to the (ICU).',\n",

The results exceeded street expectations – a Bloomberg poll pegged revenue at ₹1,38,953 crore and net profit at ₹13,704 crore for the quarter. A one-time exceptional gain of ₹797 crore beefed up the bottom line.\\n\\nAhead of the results, Reliance shares fell 1.4% to ₹1,994.45 at the close on the BSE against a 2% decline in the benchmark .\\n\\nThe oil-to-telecom conglomerate reported a net profit of ₹53,739 crore for the fiscal ended March 2021, up 34.8%, although revenue declined 18.3% to ₹5,39,238 crore.\\n\\nThe oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business, which accounts for 60% of the top line, witnessed lower volumes and realisation, but recovered in the fourth quarter following sustained demand, higher volumes and margins. “We have registered robust recovery in the O2C and retail segment, and resilient growth in the digital services business,” chairman said in the statement. “Sustained high utilisation rates across sites and improvement in downstream product deltas as well as transportation fuel margins aided O2C earnings growth.”\\n\\n\\n\\nThe company’s consumer businesses continued to grow and support customers during the pandemic and the conglomerate added almost 75,000 jobs in the year, Ambani said.\\n\\nThe company reported an exceptional gain of Rs 797 crore in the fourth quarter from the divestment of Marcellus Assets (Chevron JV) for Rs 850 crore, partially offset by a provision related to claims on divestment of GAPCO of Rs 53 crore.\\n\\nThe O2C business reported a 29% decline in annual revenue to Rs 3,20,008 crore.

Soli Jehangir Sorabjee, India’s former attorney general and a legal luminary who passed away on Friday morning at a private hospital in Delhi where he was being treated for Covid-19 was associated with both these landmark rulings. In the first, Sorabjee, along with Fali Nariman, assisted Nanabhoy Palkhivala who argued for Kesavananda Bharati. In the Maneka Gandhi case, he was representing the government as an additional solicitor general.\\n\\nIn the Maneka Gandhi case, the court praised the attorney general and the additional solicitor general for their “commendable grace and perceptive and progressive realism” in agreeing to “the happy resolution” of the dispute. Sorabjee was 91 and is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons. His daughter, Zia Mody, is an eminent lawyer and a co-founder of law firm AZB & Partners. A Padma Vibhushan recipient, Sorabjee was also a jazz aficionado and used to play the clarinet as well.\\n\\n“Being a champion of ‘Freedom of Press’, he effectively used the media as a platform to elucidate the nuances of complicated legal issues on almost daily basis till recently, literally giving lessons of law to millions of common people who otherwise could not have followed what was happening in the judicial world,” Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said in his statement. “His humane and compassionate approach defined his legal work.

Subsequently, he became a member of the UN Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. Between 1998 and 2004, he was its chairman. \" was a great lawyer and a champion of free speech and civil liberties. His free spirit was reflected in his love of jazz and poetry. I remember him in the forests of Mahabaleshwar, reading poetry below the polo ground,” senior advocate Darius Khambata said. “Soli was an inspiration for many of us from our law college days,” said Manjula Chawla, co-founder and partner at Phoenix Legal. “He was an institution in himself but always kind and gracious to us, younger lawyers.”\\n\\nAn alumnus of the Government Law College, Mumbai, he was admitted to the bar in 1953. In 1971, Sorabjee was designated as a senior advocate by the Supreme Court. He was the attorney general of India during 1989-90 and 1998-2004. “I often tell young lawyers, if you think you will come here and make money, then you are in the wrong place, go and do import-export or become a builder, that is more lucrative monetarily,” Sorabjee said once during a Mumbai visit. “Lawyers don’t retire, they practice till they die.

Each centre was supposed to vaccinate 200 people,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI.\\n\\nVaccination for this phase is only through prior registration with walk-ins disallowed.

Speaking to ET, he discusses President Joe Biden’s 2030 timeline for the US to halve its greenhouse gas emissions, the likely impacts of climate change on India — and the importance of global synergy in climate mitigation schemes:\\n\\nPresident Biden has announced a 2030 target for the US to halve its emissions — which American industries are likely to change most rapidly?\\nThis depends on the programs President Biden can actually implement — his first target will be to incentivise American utilities to go as carbon-free as possible by 2030. His second target will be transportation. However, this is a much more difficult sector to wean away from oil, gasoline and diesel than power as these fuels are much cheaper relatively for transport. Switching to electricity-based transportation will be more expensive and harder to accomplish. Major emitters in manufacturing will also be affected. But President Biden’s overall chances of success will be tied to the cooperation he gets from the legislature which wi l l need to support more efficient mitigation mechanisms like carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes.\\n\\nWhat is your assessment of the economic impacts of climate change on India?\\nMy research indicates that the bulk of global climate damages will bear down worryingly on low latitude countries like India. Countries like India which are closer to the equator could endure up to 80% of the global damage of climate impacts. The primary reason therefore to think of climate change as a global challenge is to help reduce the damage in such countries. Ironically, it’s hard to convince many countries to invest in climate mitigation because they don’t want to spend on something that seems to benefit another nation — this behaviour makes it harder to stop climate change.\\n\\nAgencies\\n\\nWhat are some recommendations you’d make to developed economies on mitigating global climate change?\\nI would first suggest establishing a carbon tax on emissions. This should be taxed at around ten dollars a ton of carbon. It should apply to main emitters and most mid-to high latitude economies, which are not going to be as hard hit by climate impacts, would thereby have to spend more on mitigation. Some countries are very poor and it would be unfair to burden them with the extra costs of climate mitigation. The world should help poorer households in those countries pay their share of mitigation costs — the energy expenditures of a poor household can be estimated and richer groups can increase climate aid to compensate for the higher costs of their moving to clean energy.\\n\\nThe science is extremely clear. Why are there still so many roadblocks in the path of mitigating climate change?\\nThere are two main reasons. Firstly, most mitigation schemes are still very expensive. And as much as most people would like to see climate change disappear, they are not willing to make a sacrifice to do this. Mitigations do require sacrifices in terms of lifestyles, profits, investments into renewables and so on. The second reason is that climate change is a global problem and not a national one. Even if India were to make huge reductions in its emissions, that won’t change the climate situation of India — it is only if the entire world were to make huge reductions that India’s climate situation would change. We don’t have global governance for this. Yet, this needs good global decisions.\\n\\nThe situation calls for a different approach now. I’d like to see every country do something about their own emissions — each nation should intensively research how it can reduce emissions inexpensively. Each country should establish a national carbon reduction target and find affordable solutions to reach this. That would be a practical start. The problem is that climate change is often approached by envisioning dramatic mitigation steps — but these are very expensive, so, in fact, few people want to carry these out. Most people in reality end up doing nothing at all. But there are also relatively affordable mitigations that will help us get started. To solve global climate change, we need a realistic middle ground between wanting to do nothing and trying to do too much.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nYale UniversityJoe BidenClimate MitigationEmissionsCarbon Tax\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\nANI\\nCOVID-19 CASES\\nWorld\\nIndia\\nConfirmed\\n32,695,030\\nDeaths\\n437,830\\nJaspreet Rai is desperately trying to do her part for the country she left more than 30 years ago: help its people breathe.\\n\\nRai, 53, who moved to Endicott, New York -- the birthplace of IBM -- from Punjab, in India, is the founder of Sanrai International, a provider of oxygen concentrators. With India now the epicenter of the pandemic, counting about 3,500 Covid-19 deaths daily, and oxygen supplies running out, Rai has rushed to help her former homeland cope with its worst crisis in recent history.\\n\\n“This is probably the hardest time they’re going through,” Rai said of her 100-strong staff on the ground, who will supply 30,000 units across India in May, several times the 1,500 Sanrai normally provides in a year. “When you don’t have equipment, and you’re trying to hold people, and they’re gasping, literally gasping for air. And you’re like, look, I’ve sold my last unit, I have to wait until the next stock comes in.”\\n\\nLike Rai, millions of Indians spread across the globe -- one of the world’s largest diasporas -- are trying to do what they can to help their country of origin as heart-wrenching images of people lining up for oxygen cylinders, waiting outside hospitals for a bed or huddling around funeral pyres flash across their screens. Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\n\\nThe number of daily new coronavirus cases in India on Saturday topped the 400,000 mark for the first time, pushing the total infections to more than 19 million. That milestone was crossed on a day when the nation opened its vaccination program to all adults.\\n\\nFeeling Helpless\\nThe diaspora is collecting funds, lobbying governments in countries where they reside and making pledges to shuttle essential supplies and equipment. But the scale of the task is leaving many feeling helpless as the health-care infrastructure in the world’s second-most populous country teeters on the brink of collapse.\\n\\n“They need doctors and hospitals,” said Venktesh Shukla, general partner at Monta Vista Capital in Silicon Valley. “I’ve been struggling for the last three to four days to figure out what to do. Like a lot of Indians, we want to do something. We just can’t find a short-term solution to help.”\\n\\nIn spite of that frustration, the need to “do something” in the face of the unfolding tragedy is spurring many into action.\\n\\nLike Sudhir Ravi. Little did Ravi know he would be embarking on a humanitarian mission when the Chicago-based private equity boutique TJM Capital Partners, where he is an operating partner, bought the largest U.S. supplier of military-grade oxygen generators in a strategic acquisition in April.\\n\\nBut with Covid raging, Ravi soon identified 11 industrial strength oxygen concentrators between the U.S. and Germany that can be distributed to hospitals in India. The devices can offer oxygen to 50,000 people in the next six months.\\n\\nFor the last week, he and Raghu Gullapalli, a close contact and executive director at the LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, have been frantically looking for ways to get them to India, requesting the services of Amazon and FedEx. A consortium of Indian philanthropists have committed to cover the $100,000 cost of shipment, and Ravi said they’re hoping to get the cargo in the air on May 5.\\n\\n“Right now, time is measured in lives,” said Gullapalli.\\n\\nBillionaire Action\\nIndian-born billionaires and executives are also piling in with help. Tech investor Vinod Khosla tweeted that he’s willing to send supplies by the “planeload.” Google, headed by Sundar Pichai, promised $18 million in cash assistance to victims’ families and medical equipment. Microsoft Corp., led by CEO Satya Nadella, pledged to draw on the company’s network to provide essential supplies.\\n\\nIn the U.K., home to around two million Indians, aid has come from people like steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Karan Bilimoria, who helped draw support from companies as the first Indian head of the Confederation of British Industry.\\n\\n“We are focused on getting this help that is desperately needed as quickly as possible,” said Bilimoria, whose company produces Cobra beer, a staple of Indian restaurants in the U.K. Air Liquide SA, the French gas supplier that helps create the bubbles in Bilimoria’s beer, has pledged its oxygen production in India to support Covid patients.\\n\\nMittal’s Indian operations are providing 210 metric tons of liquid oxygen a day. “Helping the people of India means helping India, and that’s crucial for the entire world,” he said in an emailed statement.\\n\\nThe charitable foundation of U.K.-based billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought supermarket chain Asda, donated 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) to four hospitals in the western Indian state of Gujarat, from where their family hails.\\n\\nVaccine Woes\\nAs life in the U.K. and the U.S. edges ever closer to pre-pandemic normal, for Indians abroad worrying about family and friends, the unequal access to vaccines is becoming evident. Only 2% of the people in India have been fully vaccinated compared with 30% in the U.S. and 21% in the U.K., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.\\n\\nMonta Vista’s Shukla said he and 60 other influential Indians lobbied to convince the Joe Biden administration to free up vaccine supplies and steroids. The U.S. has decided to start shipping drugs like AstraZeneca’s vaccine and Remdesivir to India.\\n\\nYet for all that, there’s only so much even powerful Indians can do remotely as raw material and equipment shortages, freight delays and labor limits hamper efforts on the ground.\\n\\n“There’s only so many oxygen concentrators available in the market,” said Jitesh Gadhia, a British politician and a trustee of the British Asian Trust who has helped lead the U.K. government’s response and engagement with suppliers. “I am concerned that so many people trying to buy a limited stock will just raise prices. What we need is more supply.”\\n\\nAnd that won’t be easy. While in Endicott Rai is trying to find charter flights to get around bottlenecks to transport her oxygen concentrators to India from China, she said units her company can provide in a month “could probably just be used in one day.”\\n\\nRai, who started her company after her asthmatic grandmother died in 2008 needing oxygen, said she’s saddened by the continued fight in India over something as essential as the air one breathes.\\n\\n“I couldn’t understand how something so basic as oxygen was so complicated,” she said. “And that question is what I’ve been trying to answer for the past 13 years.”\\n\\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin and Gina Turner.\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAmazonCovidIBMRaviCoronavirusGoogleRemdesivirPandemic\\n9 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nZillionaire\\n119 days ago\\nWonderful and very creditable.

The investment companies technically fall under the definition of ‘deemed ’ - and will hence be regulated by RBI.\\n\\nMost HNIs use investment vehicles to invest their personal wealth in an array of investments. Many hold equities in some of their listed companies through investment arms. “Some investment companies set up by ultra-rich HNIs for investments in listed and unlisted space fall under the definition of ‘deemed NBFCs’ and are regulated by the RBI,” said , managing partner at law firm SNG & Partners. “Most of these companies neither borrow a single penny nor lend money to third parties.”\\n\\nSeveral corporate and individuals have undertaken massive restructuring exercises to avoid being regulated by the central bank. As per the RBI data, there are 64 companies registered as CIC, including companies owned by Tatas, Aditya Birla, and . Mails sent to Tata group, Aditya Birla group, Bharti Airtel and JSW on Thursday did not elicit any response as of press time Friday. Apart from these 64 companies, most promoters and investors who have not registered their investment arms with the RBI will also be impacted.\\n\\nRBI has put certain conditions for considering any company as an NBFC even if it’s not into lending. These include if a company holds 90% of its assets in the form of equity shares and its asset size is more than Rs 100 crore. “Many HNIs had invested through companies and the net worth of these companies had skyrocketed in the last one year, resulting in them falling under a de-facto definition of NBFC,” said Uday Ved, partner at tax advisory firm KNAV. “These companies will now have to be restructured in a way that they do not fall under the technical definition of a deemed NBFC, but in all practical purposes these companies are not NBFCs.”\\n\\nThe fear is that if RBI was to regulate these investment arms, then this could lead to legal complications. In most cases, promoters want to make sure that either they restructure the investment arms as non-companies or add additional layering so that it doesn’t technically become a CIC. Many investors who have not registered their companies with the RBI are not aware that their investment arms are now technically NBFCs, legal experts said.\\n\\nWhile the impact is on large investors, the spurt in the stock markets in the last one year also means that several investors have seen their investment arms cross the Rs 100-crore mark, experts said.',\n",

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan-an anti-Pakistan militant group-was weakened by leadership losses, but recently announced its reunification with two splinter groups to bolster its capabilities,\" he said.\\n\\n\"While Pakistani intelligence continues to provide material support and safe haven to the Taliban, Islamabad continues to support Afghan peace efforts, encouraging the Taliban to engage in dialogue with the Afghan Government,\" he added.\\n\\nBerrier said that Pakistan\\'s relations with India continue to remain tense since New Delhi\\'s August 2019 revocation of Kashmir\\'s semiautonomous status.\\n\\nDuring the year, tensions with India probably will remain elevated, and concerted efforts by both sides to fully implement the February 25, 2021 ceasefire will be necessary to reduce tension along the Line of Control.\\n\\nPakistan perceives nuclear weapons as key to its national survival, specifically to counter the threat from India\\'s growing conventional force superiority, and likely will increase its nuclear stockpile in 2021.\\n\\nTo that end, Pakistan continues to modernise and expand its nuclear capabilities by conducting training with its deployed weapons and testing developmental missiles.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNarendra ModiIndian ArmyIndian NavyTalibanLine Of ControlForeign PolicyIndia\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n5 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nMuthukrishna Pitchumani\\n118 days ago\\nInsteasd of Modi if congo regime had been there, xiping would have been our present indian prime minister, india every part from north to south one by one, for filling congi coffers, being sold to PLA under MOU from Congi under the able leadership of Pappu and PC, keeping hundreds of more crores in virgin islands.\\nValerian Pereira\\n119 days ago\\nwhen the U.N and the world body is just watching..The aggressor.. trespassing our LAC..LAxman Rekha what are we expected to do?Its about time that inndia too work on Cber..AI..All High tech..defense projects and defend our Land and also protect the International communityas these big guys simply..walk into an Annexe what they want.where they wantHow?why?Time to be extremely Aggressive. and put the enemy in place.\\nBadri Vinayak\\n120 days ago\\n4 chinese soldiers?

And also the Indian American community.

This time, we in the United States, our people in the government, but also in the private sector... I\\'ve never seen such an outpouring of support from our corporate friends, and partners, as we\\'ve seen over the last several days,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What we are coordinating is the most significant outpouring of support for people that I\\'ve never seen from the corporate community.

The stock goes straight to hospitals from the distributors under supervision of the state government. In this chain of supply, the chemists are not involved, so they can\\'t be blamed for hoarding.\"\\n\\nElaborating on a large scale requirement of life saving drugs for critical Covid patients, Rajiv Singhal said that taking note of daily cases of around 3.75 lakh in India, at least 70,000 patients would need a Remdesivir injection. \"As each patient requires 6 vials, the country would need over 4 lakh Remdesivir injections every day. We hope as most manufacturers have ramped up their production, the crisis of short supply of Remdesivir would be over,\" the General Secretary of AIOCD added. According to him, other medicines like Fabiflu and Tocilizumab were also in shortage due to sudden surge in demand. In many cases stock is not reaching chemists. Besides there were problems in procuring raw material for manufacturing Fabiflu which comes from abroad.\\n\\nOn shortage of Betadine gargle, recommended for prevention of Covid-19 by many doctors, Rajiv Singhal said that due to a surge in demand of Betadine, its manufacturing company could not meet the present requirement of the market. \"Let me tell you, people who need one bottle of Betadine, now buy 4 bottles. Everyone who can afford, wants to store such drugs. Actually this type of mindset of storing crucial medicines at home, is the reason behind the present shortage of certain medicine since the past one month.

With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Pfizer Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAbout 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts\\' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.\\n\\nSome strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\n\"The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that\\'s because you\\'re seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there\\'s still more room,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\\n\\nThe high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.\\n\\nCiting stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index was last at about 4,180.\\n\\nStocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.\\n\\nEarnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.\\n\\nHowever, \"tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That\\'s what I find amazing,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.\\n\\n\"Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,\" he said. Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard, Cummins Inc, ConocoPhillips and Pfizer Inc .\\n\\nThe first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.\\n\\nValue has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index is up about 8% in that time.\\n\\nTechnology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Apple Inc at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\nTech is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.\\n\\nWhile the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.\\n\\n\"It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\\n\\n\"We\\'re actually carving out a third group ... defensives,\" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWall Street OutlookConocoPhillipsRefinitivPfizerJPMorgan Chase & CoPfizer IncWells Fargo Investment InstituteApple IncCredit Suisse Securities\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\nBy John Kemp\\n\\nLONDON: The US Federal Reserve has signalled it will tolerate faster inflation for a time to cement the post-pandemic recovery and boost employment, but the side effect is likely to be a faster rise in commodity prices.\\n\\nThe central bank appears anxious to avoid a repeat of the slow expansion and job gains that followed the financial crisis of 2008 by adopting a more aggressive approach to stimulating the recovery.\\n\\nIn March, non-farm employment was still down by more than 8 million jobs compared with its pre-pandemic peak in February 2020, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving a large jobs gap to be filled.\\n\\nAfter its latest meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed it will seek to achieve the twin objectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run.\\n\\nThe committee noted price rises have been running persistently below target, so it aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time to make up the shortfall and anchor expectations at around the 2% level.\\n\\nBut if the Fed leaves rates low to target the slackest part of the economy - the labour market - it must intensify pressure on capacity and prices in other parts of the economy, including manufacturing and raw materials.\\n\\nINFLATION AVERAGING\\nProposals for medium-term inflation-averaging have been winning adherents for some years, but the committee appears to be planning something more ambitious - an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\n\\nThe plan is to run the economy hot to achieve faster job gains, especially among disadvantaged groups that are marginally attached to the labour force, before shifting back to inflation control later in the cycle.\\n\\nBut the resulting pressure on global supply chains while the Fed pursues employment increases is likely to generate significantly quicker price rises for raw materials and a range of manufactured items.\\n\\nBased on breakeven rates, bond traders are anticipating US consumer prices will rise at an average rate of 2.4% over the next ten years, compared with a realised average of 1.7% per year over the last decade.\\n\\nFor much of the last decade, expected inflation has been higher than the outturns, implying traders tend to overestimate price pressures.\\n\\nBut bond traders are probably correct for now, reacting to signs the Fed is prepared to tolerate significantly faster inflation to achieve faster employment gains.\\n\\nIS THERE AN UNDERSHOOT?\\nIn its statement, the Fed repeated its previous concerns about a persistent undershoot in the inflation rate, but there is no evidence for this, at least not since the middle of the last decade.\\n\\nPrice levels and inflation rates show no significant lasting impact from the coronavirus epidemic and recession in 2019, in contrast to the prolonged fall after the recession in 2008/09 and the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.\\n\\nConsumer prices have risen at an average rate of just over 2% per year over the last two years, three years and five years, according to the all-items consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nThe only evidence for a persistent undershoot is the 1.7% increase over the last ten years, influenced by unusually slow price increases between 2013 and early 2016.\\n\\nBased on the all-items consumer price index, both the rate of inflation and the level of consumer prices are in line with their long-term trend, and there is no undershoot to make up.\\n\\nThe Fed prefers more specialised measures of inflation, including the deflator for personal consumption expenditures, which is part of the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nPCE inflation has been running at 1.6-1.8% per year over the last two, three and five-year periods, and as little as 1.5% over the last ten years, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nBut PCE inflation has been below 2% almost continuously since 2014, so if the Fed wants to make up for all that undershooting, it implies much faster price increases for an extended period.\\n\\nTIGHT SUPPLY CHAINS\\nThe problem with the Fed’s new inflation averaging strategy is that it fails to specify the historical baseline from which deviations are being measured.\\n\\nWhen exactly did consumer prices move below their desired level and how much of that deviation does the central bank want to reverse and over what time horizon?\\n\\nThe lack of clarity is probably intentional since it gives the central bank flexibility to interpret if the target has been achieved and when to start tapering its bond-buying programme and raising interest rates.\\n\\nBut the strategy strongly suggests the central bank has a relatively high tolerance for faster inflation at the moment and wants to allow the economy to run hot, creating lots of jobs, for a long period.\\n\\nWith the Fed focused on maximum employment creation, it is almost inevitable global supply chains and manufacturing systems will remain stretched, generating upward pressure on goods prices and raw materials.\\n\\nNot since the 1960s has the Fed been so intensely focused on employment, when there was strong growth in output, but which eventually ended with a sharp acceleration in inflation at the end of the decade and in the 1970s.\\n\\nFor the central bank, the hope is that running the economy hot will encourage investment in additional capacity in the manufacturing and commodities sectors, creating jobs and dampening price increases over time.\\n\\nThere is a fine line between running hot and overheating, and if the central bank ends up on the wrong side, there will eventually have to be painful interest rate increases to tackle it.\\n\\nIn the meantime, high levels of consumer and business spending are likely to keep most commodities in short supply through 2021 and 2022, keeping upward pressure on raw materials and manufacturing prices.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUS Consumer PricesCommodity PricesTight SupplyUS Federal ReserveEconomyFederal Open Market CommitteeUS Bureau Of Economic AnalysisInflation\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

BJP will win 70 seats while its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) will suffer reverses and will settle for just eight seats. BJP in Assam had set a target of winning 100 plus seats for the assembly polls of 2021. Most exit polls have hinted at BJP retaining power in Assam. “BJP on its own will get a majority and will win 70 seats, while its ally AGP will win eight seats, United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) will win five seats,” Assam BJP president Ranjit Kumar Dass told media persons in Guwahati.\\n\\n“Together with allies, we will get 83 seats in the 126-member assembly. There are 21 seats which are doubtful, and we are expecting from these seats we will garner at least three seats and our tally will touch 86. In Barak valley we will get seven seats,” he said. There are 15 seats in Southern Assam’s Barak valley. In 2016, BJP had won eight seats, while All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) won four and Congress three seats.

Assam had a three-phase assembly poll and counting of ballots will take place on May 2. Congress cobbled up 10 parties led -Grand alliance (Mahajhot) to take on the BJP led alliance.

That was said by Maruti as well as Bajaj Auto NSE 0.22 %. It is going to remain a concern for some time to come despite what they may have delivered in quarterly numbers. How do you read into this commentary?\\nIf the commodity prices keep surging and staying there, then it is much easier to pass on because typically commodity prices account for 20-25% in an automobile. In a Rs 5-lakh Maruti car, if Rs 1 lakh is commodity price and even if it is subsidised by 20%, still 5-6% will be added to the sales price. Once it can be passed on, some margin sacrifice will be there but I do not see a 20% increase in the sales price.\\n\\nThe auto sector has gone through some crazy times in transitioning from BS IV to BS VI and on top of it, the 28% GST and now there is a slowdown. It is a very important manufacturing base. This year will not be a great year for autos broadly.\\n\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Tata Steel Ltd moved up by 1 in 6 months on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\nWhat about metals which have been wealth creators for investors? Yesterday, there was news that China will be removing that rebate of 13% VAT on steel exports from May 1. We have seen phenomenal gains across the board. Is it time for the commodity linked space to shine?\\nRight now they are shining like never before. So, I think there is a shortage of all kinds.\\n\\nNMDC, Tata Steel NSE 0.66 % are all rather active in today’s trading session.\\nThe capacity addition did not happen and the bumper demand for all kinds of durables had come back simultaneously. The low interest rates environment is also giving a chance. There is massive speculation in the commodities and demand is strong. It is all across. Plastics, steel, copper whatever is traded, is on fire. It is to do with the lot of liquidity sloshing around and demand being very strong after the Covid subsided in many parts of the world.\\n\\nOn the back of that, we have been talking about the cyclical theme versus defensives and the return possibility on cyclicals at a time like this. How would you be going about it?\\nIt is very challenging to manage large money which is shifting from one side to another. But we do whatever we can do with our understanding of things but one cannot sit not taking notice of the opportunities here.\\n\\nInfra is a pocket that you are still confident on given the fact that we are seeing a spending push on that front. Steel aside, will cement, infra and even real estate to some extent will continue to thrive?\\nSitting here, it looks like things are grim on the ground level, but other markets like China and the US are dollar priced. All the commodities are dollar priced and if there is a boom in China and in the US, obviously it will boom here also. That is happening and the difficult part is to fathom what it is. Is it a super cycle? Is it a temporary blip? It has gone up vertically and it can fall vertically. So, there are danger in commodities if there is a demand collapse in any part of the world. Right now. it is taken for granted that demand will surge. Till global monetary systems start tightening, we have at least one year upmove. The current trend is likely to strengthen and there is an opportunity.\\n\\nHow are you looking at capitalising on the new tech as well as strong digitisation play across the spectrum? Will it be via unlisted players? Are you looking at traditional IT plays or fintech players?\\nDigitisation is here to stay and is going to become a more important part of life. Twenty years ago, there was hardly any internet and today without internet, we cannot do anything. This is how the technology keeps becoming more and more important. Earlier tech used to be only a support function. Today if you do not have tech, howsoever good you are in your profession, I do not think you are going to make it.\\n\\nOne has to look for businesses suited for online kind of fulfilment. The capacity of financial system can be literally unlimited. If you are selling some physical goods, your capacity is limited to whatever is available. If you are selling cement, even by online you can only sell as much as you can produce. But in the case of financial services, the capacity is literally unlimited. As the volume goes up, the cost per unit goes down. The possibilities of digital economy is quite staggering and we have just about started.\\n\\nAs the digital companies in India gets listed, we are definitely going to see many companies coming in which are pure digital, 50% digital or 70% digital. The biggest thing is that people like us, who are not children of digital economy, have to improve our understanding of this particular way of thinking because digital economy, digital companies are not built for EPS and PE. They have a very different way of building businesses. Eventually they make money, there is a lot of free cash flow and that is what you value. But to start with, it could be very different and by the time you realise it is a good business, valuations get crazy. It will be difficult but we will try to learn the game and let us see whether we can really come on top of it.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRaamdeo AgrawalCyclical ThemeCommoditiesEt NowStock MarketTata SteelBajaj AutoNMDCMotilal Oswal Financial Services\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

The polls started on March 27 and concluded on April 29.\\n\\nSingh has claimed that there is an \"indirect discrimination\" against the general public as fines are collected from them for violating COVID-19 norms, but no action is taken against politicians.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCovidElection CommissionDelhi High CourtMHAPandemicMinistry Of Home AffairsSecond Wave\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nM.L.GUPTA\\n119 days ago\\nThe Home Ministry and the M/o H&FW etc. should take action against producers/sellers of \"CORONA DAVAI\".

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place.\\nGetty Images\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\nRELATED\\nFinancial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India\\n3 approaches to equity investing\\nAuto, insurance good for investment in medium to long term: Kunj Bansal\\nBy Erin Lowry\\n\\nLook around and you’d see a digital-era gold rush. There’s hype about cryptocurrencies, NFTs and GameStop-gate, not to mention the continued rise of the stock market, which many are watching through their Robinhood apps. Although some people will amass wealth through these assets, there is another form of investing that’s piqued my interest as of late.\\n\\nIn researching different ways to build wealth, I was struck by the opportunities VC and angel investors have for not only generating returns but also shaping the future.\\n\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place. They can fund ventures with innovative ideas that other investors might not see and back companies created by underrepresented founders in the startup world.\\n\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\n\\nOne issue, however, is access. As is often the case in wealth building, it takes money to make money. Angel investors are generally required to be “accredited investors.” For decades, the threshold for being accredited in the U.S. meant you needed either a net worth of $1 million, excluding a primary residence, or an individual income of at least $200,000 in each of the two most recent years ($300,000 for those filing jointly). In December 2020, the SEC expanded the definition to allow “natural persons to qualify as accredited investors based on certain professional certifications, designations or credentials or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution, which the Commission may designate from time to time by order.”\\n\\nHowever, there is a discussion about whether the net worth and income requirements are too low for today’s climate. One angel told me she felt these were too low for those in expensive cities because one would need to invest more to be adequately diversified. She’d prefer to see $5 million as the net worth minimum.\\n\\nHere’s the rationale. A 2017 survey found the median investment by an American angel was $25,000 per round to a single company. Now, let’s say you need to invest in at least 10 companies to be a diversified angel investor. That’d be a quarter-of-a-million dollars, which could mean 25% of someone’s net worth. Considering the volatility of the investments, even when properly diversified, that’s entirely too much risk. The prevailing rule of thumb is to not have more than 5% of your portfolio in speculative investments.\\n\\nBut although it makes sense to ensure investors are property diversified, this cap is incredibly restrictive. Demanding a $5 million or even $1 million net worth effectively blocks people from what can be impactful wealth building opportunities.\\n\\nFortunately, things are changing. Much like fractional shares changed the ability to invest in stocks, technology is opening up more opportunities for individuals to take advantage of angel investing. Enter equity crowdfunding.\\n\\nPlenty of millennials are familiar with crowdfunding via platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, where people ask for money to start a business or help with unexpected expenses, and funders donate without expecting any ownership in the project or repayment. Equity crowdfunding operates along a similar principle in that you pool your money with anonymous strangers on the Internet, but in this case it’s to fund a company.\\n\\nThe big difference is, you get an interest in the business. It’s akin to contributing to an index fund or fractional shares. You own a small slice of equity, depending on how much you invest.\\n\\nEquity crowdfunding comes in two common forms: accredited, which is defined the same way as above, and open-access regulated, which is open to anyone who can legally invest. Sites like Republic and WeFunder offer the regular, non-accredited investor (like me) a chance to give angel investing a try. The type of security can vary based on the startup. For example, Republic offers Crowd SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), Token Purchase Agreements for Blockchain-related projects and Crowd Simple Debt Agreements.\\n\\nWhen considering how much to invest, it’s critical to remember that this should only be a speculative part of anyone’s portfolio. Settle on an amount of money you’re comfortable losing to the cause of funding a company you believe should exist and to — let’s be honest — the hope of making some money as well.\\n\\nDon’t forget that you’re just as likely to lose significant money or see your stake diluted overtime. Stats on startup failures run the gamut, but an oft-quoted one is that 90% fail in the first three years. Even if you were to be optimistic and say 50% — that’s still good odds you’d lose your money.\\n\\nI think attempts to democratize angel investing through equity crowdfunding are worthwhile because they point to a world where it’s not only the wealthy determining which startups live or die based on who gets funding. This doesn’t mean early-stage investing is the right route for everyone or that it will yield more than dashed dreams of funding the next Google or Facebook or Uber. But it’s a compelling option if you want to put (a small percentage of) your money to work.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAngel InvestingSecAngel InvestorsStock MarketGoogleCommissionGofundmeRobinhood\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Having a manager whose leadership style puts a strain on their daily life can be a challenge – especially in uncertain times such as this. Many of us have come across various types of dysfunctional bosses- the passive aggressive one who makes those unnecessary sarcastic comments and remarks in meetings of your work, the micro-manager who wants to haunt you at every step of the project and changes/corrects every step. The abusive/aggressive one, who screams loudly to express their thoughts about everything you do. Or the stalker manager who checks on your every move at work – even when you take that much needed coffee break. Here’s how you can deal with a demanding boss, and keep your job.\\n\\n- Calm your body to calm yourself. Your body is always a good place to start to acknowledge and build awareness of defences that might be up. Focus on your body and what’s happening within. It might be helpful to take 5 mindful breathes to be able to focus on what is inside and what is outside. Neuroscience tells us that embodied practice is where real and sustainable behavioural change occurs.\\n\\n- Make sure you have identified the difference between being a boss and being bossy. This means exercising authority is not the same as being overly authoritative. Someone needs to be the one in-charge, the one to make decisions, and to make sure work is done in a timely fashion. A good boss will see when their team needs direction and will provide it in a constructive way. A bossy boss will try to control the situation by demanding certain things to be done without taking into consideration the capacity of the employee.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\n- When struggling with unrealistic deadlines or expectations it is essential to bring your expertise, gauge the scenario and not dwell into insecurity that you can’t do it. And yet if it still feels unrealistic, review it regarding how much time and effort it would actually take from your experience and then find ways to communicate that. Try chunking a big project into small tasks so as to not get overwhelmed by the deadlines placed on you.\\n\\n- Evaluate your boss’s approach and style to understand if you’ll get a better response by behaving proactively or reactively. The way boss’s work could also be a management culture. Embodying the boss’s style helps to know what to expect and how to respond to it. You'll gain valuable insights into some of the ways you may be holding yourself back from being able to make greater contributions.\\n\\n-Build empathy. It would be very difficult to be empathetic in situations that feel like a dead-end. Try to understand what is leading your boss to be this way. It will definitely help you to see and understand things from their perspective. What is the boss’s outlook? What might he/she be dealing with in their role? What challenges do they have to face?\\n\\n- Feasible and realistic solutions tend to catch more attention and acknowledgements. Be receptive to the feedback that you receive but do not accept all the feedback. If you disagree, you can communicate authentically without being aggressive or disrespectful. Approach your boss in a calm, professional, and rational manner. Asking for feedback doesn’t necessarily mean it will be positive. So be open to the idea of critical feedback. Your success also depends on the delivery and timing of your discussion; make sure you listen and are mindful of how you respond.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDemanding BossCalmBossNeuroscienceMental HealthWork StressWork From Home\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",

Those below 18 years would be most vulnerable,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After each wave flattens, we have seen a resurgence in other countries too. It’ll take 90-120 days after the wave flattens for the virus resurgence,” said Dr CN Manjunath, head, Covid-19 expert committee and nodal officer for Covid testing in the state.\\n\\nCovid live updates\\n\\nKarnataka’s experience, and that of European countries, shows that the third wave will be definitely there and preparation to tackle it must be taken seriously, say experts. Covid-appropriate behaviour like mask usage, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowds and hand hygiene, apart from vaccination, must be given utmost priority, they say.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Dr Manjunath, all precautionary measures, restrictions on gatherings, religious events, political rallies, local body elections and fairs must be continued till December 2021. “The severity will be more in unvaccinated persons. The need is to speed up vaccination,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe agreed with Dr Sudarshan that children would be more vulnerable. “There are trials of Pfizer vaccines on children. By then, we may get vaccines for children too,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to Dr KR Bharath Kumar Reddy, paediatric pulmonologist and director, Shishuka Children’s Specialty Hospital, children would be vulnerable because of lack of vaccination. “However, the virus transmission chain may break as adults at home would be vaccinated and they may not spread to kids. Currently, in most cases, adults are transmitting to children who are not going to schools,” Dr Reddy said.\\n\\nUnless those in the 18-44 years category are vaccinated by October, a high number of cases will be seen among them too, experts said.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nResurgenceCovidChildrenKarnatakaTechnical Advisory CommitteeTACThird WaveVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n6 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nvaradharajan balasubramanian\\n119 days ago\\nyoung people should know this virus can adopt itself to changing situations.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations.\\nGetty Images\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years.\\nRELATED\\nPhysical gold in India swings to discount as pandemic stalls demand\\nView: Inflation-tolerant Fed will boost commodity prices\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nCOMMODITY SUMMARY\\nMCX\\nCOPPER\\nBy Eddie Spence and Megan Durisin\\n\\nThe prices of raw materials used to make almost everything are skyrocketing, and the upward trajectory looks set to continue as the world economy roars back to life.\\n\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years. The rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations. With the U.S. economy pumped up on fiscal stimulus, and Europe’s economy starting to reopen as its vaccination rollout gets into gear, there’s little reason to expect a change in direction.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. said this week it sees a continued rally in commodities and that the “reflation and reopening trade will continue.” On top of that, the Federal Reserve and other central banks seem calm about inflation, meaning economies could be left to run hot, which will rev up demand even more.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\n“The most important drivers supporting commodity prices are the global economic recovery and acceleration in the reopening phase,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. The bank expects commodities as a whole to rise about 10% in the next year.\\n\\nChina, a crucial source of supply and demand for raw materials, is playing a big role, particularly as the government tries to reduce production of key metals like steel and aluminum. It’s also buying up massive amounts of grains. Food prices are also being affected as poor weather in key growing nations like Brazil and France hits harvests.\\n\\nAs just about every basic material gets rapidly more expensive, here’s some ways the rally is rippling across the globe to create winners and losers.\\n\\nGoing Green\\nCopper has enjoyed an unstoppable rally for more than a year thanks to pledges by governments to boost renewable energy and electric vehicle use. That’ll make all the various forms of green technology that rely on it a bit more expensive.\\n\\nBigger power grids is one such case. About 1.9 million tons of copper was used to build electricity networks in 2020, according to BloombergNEF, and the price of the red metal is up more than 90% in the past year. Usage will almost double by 2050, BNEF forecasts, while demand from other low carbon technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels will also balloon.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBuyers and Sellers\\nFor countries, the impact of the commodity rally depends on whether they’re an exporter or importer. For those relying heavily on exporting raw materials, the huge upswings can only be good news for public finances, especially when they’ve just been stricken by a once-in-a-century pandemic. The likes of Australia (iron ore), Chile (copper) and Indonesia (palm oil) all make huge sums from commodities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, countries looking to rebuild infrastructure may find their budgets buy less than they used to. President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion plan is one such case. Electricity grids, railways and refurbishing buildings are among the items on the shopping list that will use large amounts of metal.\\n\\nConsultancy CRU Group estimates the program will add 5 million tons of steel to the 80 million the U.S. uses each year, with similar boosts to aluminum and copper demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nMeat\\nIt’s been a tough year to be in the meat business, from devastating Covid outbreaks to the deadly pig disease that hit Germany and is roaring back in China.\\n\\nAnd as crop prices surge, farmers rearing poultry, pigs and cattle are among the first to get squeezed by the eye-watering run-up in grains. Costs for corn fed to livestock have doubled in the past year, and soybean meal is more than 40% higher. While there’s a delay before that hits the burger chain or steakhouse, there are already signs of prices creeping higher.\\n\\nOld Steel Mills\\nSteel producers in Europe and America have suffered for years from low prices caused by global overcapacity. Plants struggled to make money and job security became a growing worry. Over 85,000 steel jobs were lost in the European Union between 2008 and 2019, according to industry association Eurofer.\\n\\nThat’s all changed dramatically thanks to booming steel prices. Futures in China, by far the biggest producer, have smashed records — even outpacing gains in key ingredient iron ore — as the government took measures to curb output. That’s supercharged rallies of benchmark prices in Europe and America, where mills were already running at maximum capacity as they try to meet unexpectedly high demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBreakfast Tables\\nWhether you prefer latte or espresso, sweetened or plain, the key ingredients of a cup of coffee have surged. Arabica coffee futures have risen about 33% in the past year, while raw sugar has also advanced. Fancy a slice of toast? Benchmark wheat prices have hit the highest since 2013.\\n\\nOf course, rising commodities don’t immediately show up on grocery shelves and cafe menus. They make up just a part of the costs for retailers, which often absorb the initial increase to keep customers coming back. But there’s a limit to that margin hit, and high prices could ultimately feed through to consumers.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSteelLumberCornUBS Group AGEuropean UnionCopperCommoditiesFederal Reserve\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Shares of the video game retailer and many other meme stocks that rallied in its wake are well off their highs, and retail trading has dropped from levels seen earlier in the year.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing some return of interest to those Reddit-type stocks but not with the same pace and fervor we saw before,\" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management.\\n\\nStill, some market-watchers believe a smaller-scale face-off between retail investors and short sellers may have sparked part of the volatility in MicroVision and other recent movers.\\n\\nAverage short interest in a basket of 50 stocks with market capitalization of under $100 billion monitored by Vanda Research has climbed to levels last seen in January, the firm said in a report earlier this week.\\n\\nAt the same time, cash equity purchases and the premium spent on call options for MicroVision and some of the other gainers soared in recent weeks, an indicator of retail buying, according to analysts at Vanda, which tracks retail activity.\\n\\n\"With the precedent of Melvin Capital in mind, we suspect that the long/short community started to trim bearish bets as soon as they sniffed a potential comeback from the Reddit crowd,\" Vanda’s analysts wrote.\\n\\nMicroVision, which traded below $1 as recently as June 2020, is up 210% since short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the company’s stock on Dec. 22, illustrating the potential dangers bearish investors face when positioning against meme stocks. Hindenburg Research did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\n“Right now you can have a perfectly logical reason to short a stock and still take a terrible beating if a group of small traders pull together to push the stock in the other direction,\" said Phipps.\\n\\nWATCHING WSB\\nCarson Block, founder of short seller Muddy Waters Research, said he keeps a keen eye on online chatter and forums such as WallStreetBets, where users often attempt to coordinate their buying in stocks they believe are short-squeeze candidates.\\n\\n“We are now watching closely,” said Block.\\n\\nBlock said he is now more focused on technical aspects such as companies where a high percentage of stock is owned by insiders and institutional investors that are unlikely to sell the shares.\\n\\nWhether the stars will align anytime soon for another move on the scale of GameStop\\'s remains to be seen. That stock had a combination of short interest that peaked at about 145% of the float, according to S3 Partners data, a massive following among retail investors and institutions happy to jump in on the shares\\' wild ride.\\n\\nInvestors are “looking for history possibly to repeat or looking for stocks that are going to go parabolic,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. However, “GameStop was such an outlier in price moves that (it) is difficult for that to happen again.”\\n\\nThere are signs, however, that broader trading activity among retail investors may be picking up.\\n\\nIn the latest week, there was $700 million in net retail buying of large-cap companies tracked by JPMorgan, compared with $500 million in the previous period, the bank said in a report issued on Wednesday.\\n\\nVanda Research said purchases of single stocks by retail investors have ticked higher, though they remain much lower than in previous months. Meanwhile, buying of exchange-traded funds by retail investors fell earlier in the week to its lowest levels since late last year, a potential sign they may be ready to take on more risk, the firm said.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nMeme StocksS3 PartnersJPMorganWallstreet BetsVideo Game Retailer Gamestop CorpPhippsMelvin CapitalGameStop CorpStocks\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Household size was an important explanatory factor for the disparity for COVID-19 mortality in South Asian groups only.\\n\\nDr Mathur said: \"While multigenerational living may increase risk of exposure and transmission (from children or working age adults to older or vulnerable family members), such households and extended communities also offer valuable informal care networks and facilitate engagement with health and community services.\\n\\n\"In light of emerging evidence that minority ethnic groups are less likely to take up the COVID-19 vaccine, co-designing culturally competent and non-stigmatising engagement strategies with these communities is increasingly important.\"\\n\\nOn behalf of NHS England, the research team used the new secure OpenSAFELY data analytics platform to analyse partially anonymised electronic health data collected by general practitioners (GPs) covering 40 per cent of England.\\n\\nThese GP records were linked to other national coronavirus-related data sets for the first and second waves of the pandemic - including testing, hospital data and mortality records. Ethnicity was self-reported by participants in GP records and grouped into five census categories (white, South Asian, Black, other, mixed) and then a further 16 sub-groups.\\n\\n\"Minority ethnic groups in the UK are disproportionately affected by factors that also increase the risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, such as living in deprived areas, working in front-line jobs, and having poorer access to healthcare,\" notes Dr Mathur.\\n\\n\"Our study indicates that even after accounting for many of these factors, the risk for testing positive, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death was still higher in minority ethnic groups compared with white people in England.\\n\\n\"To improve COVID-19 outcomes, we urgently need to tackle the wider disadvantage and structural racism faced by these communities, as well as improving access to care and reducing transmission,\" she said.\\n\\nThe authors caution that there are some limitations to the study including an inability to capture all potential explanatory variables, including occupation, health-related behaviours, and experiences of racism or structural discrimination.\\n\\nThey call for improving the completeness of ethnicity recording in health data to further support the conduct of high-quality research into addressing health inequalities for COVID-19 and beyond.\\n\\nThe study, believed to be the largest of its type, was funded by the UK\\'s Medical Research Council and conducted by scientists from a group of universities including LSHTM and the University of Oxford, along with the National Institute of Health Research.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nTesting PositiveCovidNHS EnglandLondon School Of Hygiene & Tropical MedicineCoronavirusMinority Ethnic GroupsLancetUniversity Of Oxford\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nBank of Baroda, RBL and IDFC First could double from here: Sanjiv Bhasin\\nGame not over in pharma, chemicals: Pashupati Advani\\nIf you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now, says Naveen Kulkarni, CIO, Axis Securities Ltd.\\n\\n2020 was all about Reliance and those big deals that we saw for Jio and retail. What will be the next picture for RIL NSE -0.14 %? That’s what the markets would want to know.\\nIf you look at Reliance Industries, the stock did pretty well till October or so. November onwards, the stock started cooling off and from highs closer to Rs 2,300, the stock has been hovering between Rs 1,800-2,200. The stock has corrected and there has been some bit of derating also that has happened.\\n\\nBut having said that, the critical aspect is how the overall industry cycle is going to pan out. If the O2C segment starts doing better, then I think there is a play because the stock has been an underperformer for the last four to five months. The important aspect that we need to see is how sustainable these trends are going to be. The current quarter numbers look quite encouraging. If the trend continues to be an upcycle, there is much scope for the stock to do well just based on the operating performance.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Reliance Industries Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAs far as other triggers are concerned, the Aramco deal is pretty much one aspect that we could be looking at. Apart from that, if the retail business or digital services business gets listed on foreign bourses, those could be the trigger. It could be the long-term trigger but from an operating performance perspective, the O2C segment is going to be very critical. We already know how the Jio platform business is panning out. The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place. Other businesses are where they see more value to be created, especially the O2C segment.\\n\\nWould it make sense for Reliance shareholders to hold a stake in Aramco and give up stake in O2C? Will the deal be as attractive as a plain cash for stake deal?\\nIt is difficult to make a case for that at this point in time. It remains to be seen how a pure share swap deal will enthuse the investors. Cash has also its own advantages as well as disadvantages. But we will have to wait and watch out what exactly is on offer. Also, an important factor will be what it could mean in terms of controlling stake and how the company is going to be run. Those will be the critical aspects that one will have to watch out for. It is difficult to gauge the benefits at this point in time. But it might be a very interesting thing to look at. We have not had something like this in India as far as I can remember. So that will be something that we all will be looking forward to.\\n\\nWould we see Reliance Industries’ three main businesses being hived off into three different divisions? Is that something all of you in the markets and the analysts community are still following up?\\nMore important aspect will be how the holding structure will pan out once the business is structured. There are a lot of moving parts here. One is to look at that sum of the parts and say that the value of the sum of the parts is probably higher than what the market is ascribing to in terms of numbers. But the important aspect would be how the structuring will actually happen and more importantly, how the businesses will be run after that.\\n\\nIt is like two to three steps ahead of what we are able to analyse at this point in time in terms of the sum of parts valuation. So it remains to be seen. If you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now. But the challenge has been that it is difficult to envisage how the structure of the company will evolve post that and that is why the market is ascribing the value to what the sum of the parts valuation entails. So we will have to wait and watch out how that happens, but as far as the analyst community is concerned, the sum of the parts valuation for these three businesses are very much considered and that is the way that company is being valued now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSegment PicksJioReliance IndustriesAramcoRilNaveen KulkarniRill O2C Business\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

As many as 15,523 people have died since the outbreak of the pandemic last year.\\n\\nCiting Maharashtra where a 44-day lockdown brought the infection under control to a good extent, Sudhakar appealed to the people to follow the regulations instead of loitering around unnecessarily.\\n\\nTo a question on the vaccination drive for people above 18 years of age, which could not take off fully from May 1 as was announced by the Central government, he said adequate stock of vaccine did not arrive due to which the drive was started symbolically by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa with the available stock of three lakh vaccines.\\n\\n\"We have a stock of vaccines, which is not huge to meet the requirement. We will inform people once the vaccines arrive in the State,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Health Minister said the State government has set a target to vaccinate everyone.\\n\\nTo a question on shortage of drugs and oxygen, he said there is unnecessary panic among people who are hoarding Remdesivir vials and oxygen fearing that they would not get in case of an emergency. According to him, at least 85 per cent of the infected people remain asymptomatic whereas only five to eight per cent show moderate symptoms.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDr K SudhakarKarnatakaLockdownHealth Minister\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " \"Synopsis\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports.\\nGetty Images\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level.\\nRELATED\\nSelloff shows market to remain shackled by Covid fears for now\\nDIIs emerge smart buyers as bulls & bears play tug of war\\nForeign investors bet on economy rebound as they look beyond India's Covid-19 crisis\\nNifty’s trading range remained wider than usual during the week gone by, but it took a serious cut on Friday’s session. Despite that, the index managed to close the week on a positive note. In the previous weekly note, we had mentioned that Nifty was trading inside the Falling Channel that it had created, and any decisive move above the 15,000 mark would offer cues about the market’s upward move.\\n\\nHowever, the index has failed to move past that point and stayed inside the channel. Following a rangebound week, the headline index finally ended with a net gain of 289 points (+2.02%) on a weekly basis.\\n\\nIn the week before this one, Nifty had violated an important pattern support that comes in the form of a Rising Trend Line drawn from the lows of March 2020. Despite the violation of this pattern support, Nifty averted weakness this time by managing to hang around precariously near this trend line.\\n\\nVolatility has risen and INDIA VIX has grown marginally by 1.49% to 23.0300 level. For the coming week and beyond, it would be crucially important for the 50-pack to stay above this trend line, and any failure to do so will increase the possibility of violation of the Falling Channel that the Nifty is in. This can also invite incremental weakness in the market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports. In the event of any corrective move, this trading range is likely to widen. The weekly RSI stands at 58.86; it stays neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD remains bearish and stays below the Signal Line.\\n\\nA Shooting Star formation has emerged on the candles. Such a formation would occur when the price shows a gapup start, trends higher, but closes much lower being unable to sustain the gains.\\n\\nSince such a candle has emerged near a pattern resistance level, it can have bearish implications. However, as always, this would require confirmation on the next bar. Pattern analysis showed Nifty is inside a channel that it has formed; and it has not been able to break out of this channel and is clinging on to an important pattern support of a trend line that begins from March 2020 lows and joins the subsequent higher bottoms.\\n\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level. While the market is in seeing such a retracement, the out-of-control Covid situation in the country is hitting investor sentiment hard. There is a clear shift in preference towards the traditionally defensive stocks.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nWe recommend staying highly stock-specific and keeping fresh purchases limited to low-beta and defensive stocks. All rallies should be used more for taking some money off the table rather than making fresh purchases. While keeping the overall exposures at a modest level, a highly cautious outlook is advised for the coming week.\\n\\nIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectoral indices against CNX500 (Nifty500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free-float market-cap of all the listed stocks.\\n\\nTJE review of RRG showed only Metal, Midcap100 and the Commodity Indices are showing steady relative momentum while being placed inside the leading quadrant. Energy, Infrastructure and PSE Indices are inside the leading quadrant, but they all appear to be losing their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty PSU Bank, Realty and Nifty Bank Indices are all inside the weakening quadrant. All of them appear to be rotating south-west and giving up their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to relatively underperform the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Financial Services index has rolled inside the lagging quadrant, while the Auto Index is languishing inside this quadrant. Nifty IT and Media indices are also inside this quadrant, but they were seen improving their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Consumption Index has just rolled inside the improving quadrant. It joins Nifty Pharma and FMCG indices, which are also inside the improving quadrant. They appear to be steadily maintaining their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to show a resilient performance and relatively outperform the broader market.\\n\\nImportant Note: RRGTM charts show the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. In the above chart, they show relative performance against the Nifty500 Index (broader market) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.\\n\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA is a Consultant Technical Analyst and founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, Vadodara.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\nAgencies\\nRepresentative Image\\nIndia is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic. On April 25, 2021, we reported over 3.5 lakh cases of fresh infections from the coronavirus. This was the highest ever single day account since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from the steep surge in the rate of infections, another pressing concern is the rising fatality rate. Onwards April 19, 2021, we have been losing over 2000 lives daily to the virus.\\n\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\n\\nIndia’s Vaccination Plan\\nThe first phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, 2021. It aimed to inoculate 30 crores of people by July 2021 with a target of 70 lakh doses administered daily. In line with WHO’s recommendations, the beneficiaries of the first phase were healthcare and frontline workers. Subsequently, the second phase of the inoculation drive saw the net being widened. People over the age of 60, or people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, were eligible beneficiaries. On April 1, 2021, the second phase was extended to people of 45 years and above. The third phase of the vaccination would be set in motion from May 1, 2021. It will provide access to vaccines for people in the age group of 18-45 years of age.\\n\\nThe National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration opted for the distribution of the vaccines as per age groups. This made sense as the fatalities recorded in people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities were significantly higher. However, the slow rate of vaccination at 8.7 % of the total population in 90 days compared to 36.3 % in the US and 32.3 % in the UK is proving to be counter-intuitive of this theory. The sluggishness is partly due to the initial vaccine hesitancy followed soon after by huge vaccine shortage. May be this was one reason for PM Modi to exhort the nation into celebration of 'Tika Utsav' vaccination festival from April 11 to April 14. However, the doses administered during the Tika Utsav fell due to supply constraints.\\n\\nVaccine shortage\\nBetween April 1 and April 2021, on an average 36 lakh doses were administered across the country. But, during the Tika Utsav, on an average only 32 lakh doses were administered. As many as 900 inoculation centres (65 %) were closed all over Odisha because of unavailability of vaccines. Odisha was only provided one-tenth of its demand for 25 lakh vaccines for 10 days for the Tika Utsav, despite the state achieving negative vaccine wastage. Average vaccinations have shrunk from 32 lakhs during the Tika Utsav to just about 25 lakhs between April 15 and April 26. Whereas a record low of 9 lakh vaccinations took place on April 25, the day the country recorded its highest ever daily cases of fresh infections.\\n\\nThis problem is likely to get accentuated in phase 3 of the vaccination process due to acute shortage in manufacture and supply of vaccines. Odisha, for example, does not expect its vaccination to start before May 15 for Covaxin and end of May for Covishield.\\n\\nUnlike other countries which boldly stockpiled corona virus vaccines even when they were undergoing clinical trials, India probably played inexplicably safe. We continued to put ad hoc orders and did not strengthen the production line of Bharat Biotech (BB) (producer of Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (SII) (producer of Covishield) until recently. Maybe we assumed that there would not be a second wave.\\n\\nBurden on the States\\nAdded to the above, the higher price of both the vaccines for states has put them under enormous fiscal burden. In the third phase, beginning May 1, cumulatively about 60 crores of population (aged between 18-45 years) would be eligible for vaccination in various states whereas the national age-wise distribution of population over the age of 45 accounts for only about 34 crores. This implies that there is a disproportionate fiscal pressure on the states most of whom have understandably already declared universal free vaccinations. This is further aggravated manifold by a higher pricing (Rs.400-Rs.600) of both the vaccine types for the states compared to the Centre (Rs.150 per dose) even while all earlier universal immunization efforts in India have been Central schemes with a pre-determined sharing pattern between Centre and states to keep the implementation simple.\\n\\nThe states could have harnessed this money towards strengthening the already noticeable inadequate infrastructure in the district and sub-district hospitals, preparing for a possible third wave. Additionally, the higher price of Covaxin and Covishield for private hospitals would crowd out the private sector and their infrastructure and manpower from this national effort as people would throng government centres for free shots, thus putting enormous pressure on the existing fragile government–run vaccination centres.\\n\\nWay Forward\\nVaccinate and vaccinate fast. This is the best-fit solution. Along with Covid appropriate behaviour, an expedited vaccination drive is the need of the hour to break the chain of transmission. Currently, we have only vaccinated about 10 persons per capita while Brazil and China have vaccinated 18 and 16 persons per capita. At present, the centre should enforce immediate compulsory licensing under Patent Act for both the manufacturers while simultaneously approving a greater number of manufactures and vaccine types to preclude possibilities of cartelisation and profiteering. This would allow other manufacturers without infringing on intellectual property. Additionally, India should continue to advocate for relaxation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) given the global health emergency to quickly ramp up production of vaccines.\\n\\n(The author is Member of Rajya Sabha of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) from Odisha.

       " \"Synopsis\\n‘The year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses’\\nETMarkets.com\\nGoing forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nRIL stock may rally if O2C segment picks up: Naveen Kulkarni\\nPharma, chemicals, speciality chemicals game not over; look at infra too: Pashupati Advani\\nThe margin trends of consumer companies will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities.\\n\\nWhat is the stance that you will be taking on banks going forward? Is it the lending services where one needs to have a larger exposure or should one focus on corporate-facing banks or retail-oriented ones? Where should one actually hold positions?\\nThe results of most of the banks were slightly disappointing to begin with. I was quite surprised when most of these banks started going up this week. They had indeed moderated over the last one day but overall, the week has been good for the banks. The results were quite bad for most of the banks because if you look at the NPA trend and really focus on the quality of the earnings that have been reported, the proforma invoices are pretty large for most of the banks. You can clearly make out the distinction between two sets of banks; banks that have made good amounts of provisions versus banks that have not made good amounts of provisions. They are also struggling with their capitalisation ratio, i.e., the tier one capitalisation.\\n\\nIf you distinguish these parameters, you will notice that the year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses to be borne with as we go forward.\\n\\nAs it is, we have now this vicious second wave of Covid coming in and that is going to create a whole lot of problems for the banking sector. Going forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors and if you ask me frankly, the markets are going to get a little jittery as we close out the May month.\\n\\nHow are you looking at some of the consumption companies that have come out with their earnings? Given the kind of commentary they have given in terms of the volume growth and given the current environment, what is it that you are expecting in terms of trends from consumers?\\nConsumer companies have reported good earnings and most of them actually have reported margins against the fear that commodity costs were going up. The margin trends have been quite good. Volume growth, of course, has been in double digits and that is what was expected from most of the consumer companies. We also know that the logistics are unaffected due to government’s lockdown measures.\\n\\nGiven this situation, for most of the consumer companies who are dependent on logistics companies, there is a lot of e-commerce kind of distribution happening. There are also a lot of digitisation moves that we are seeing. We will encourage most of the FMCG companies to maintain their growth trends ahead.\\n\\nHowever, I still believe that the margin trends will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost push that we had seen come into their earnings in the first quarter. So again, going forward it will be a little bit negative for FMCG companies. The margin trends will be weaker. But the only good point that we should acknowledge here is most of them should be looking at better volume growth as we move ahead.\\n\\nWhat is your outlook on the entire infrastructure/capital goods space? What is it that you are factoring in by way of the execution of the ordering trends in light of the second wave?\\nMost of the infrastructure project activities are subdued as you have labour shortages. You even have material shortages coming in certain places and order intake has been quite weak. Most of the orders that you are seeing are driven by government orders, which are pending for several months and therefore being expedited now. There is no fresh capex intent that we are seeing in a big manner and therefore, the overall capital goods and infrastructure space is going to be a little weaker.\\n\\nAlso, remember that the inflation is perking up a little bit and we sense that somewhere, the RBI will have to step in either with the rate increase or an outlook that tries to tighten the overall money supply situation so that inflation is in a way reined in. Any rise in inflation and thereby rise in interest rates does not augur really well for most of the infrastructure companies or most of the capital goods companies. So the outlook remains quite weak for the capital goods companies.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCapital Goods StocksMargin TrendsRBIFmcgInfrastructure StocksGood EarningsConsumer CompaniesNPAMahantesh Sabarad\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

       " 'Synopsis\\nThis time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up.\\niStock\\nSkinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over.\\nRELATED\\nHow e-commerce has changed shopping rules in the pandemic\\nThese robots are helping residents of Singapore with grocery shopping\\nCovid19 second wave-led local restrictions, curfews halve malls, shopping centres’ revenue\\nWomen are saying yes to the dress. The garment has become one emblem of the post-lockdown consumer, as economies slowly reopen in places like the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nAnd dressier clothing is just the start of what may be a “great rotation” in consumer spending. At the end of last year, we argued that a vaccine-driven economic recovery would shift what people buy — they’d order less leisure wear and buy fewer cushions, but put more money toward champagne, suits and experiences. In categories like fashion and cosmetics, this shift is indeed happening; however, other areas like dining, travel and big events have yet to really get going.\\n\\nUntil trips to offices and sunny climes pick up again, retailers and manufacturers will have to manage this sputtering recovery and deal with levels of demand that may be much more, or much less, than they expected.\\n\\nUrban Outfitters Inc. was the first to signal the return to dressing up. It said that at its Anthropologie brand in the last week of February, seven of its 10 best-selling online items were dresses. Over the previous year, one or two dresses at most would have made the top 10.\\n\\nWhen British retail reopened in June and December 2020, shoppers bought many of the same things they were ordering in lockdown — lots of leisurewear and lingerie. This time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up, as are handbags and mascara (yes to above-the-mask makeup). There’s far less interest in comfortable clothes made for lounging at home.\\n\\n“Fashion is back,” declared Associated British Foods Plc, the owner of budget chain Primark. Clothing is undergoing its own metamorphosis: Skinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over. This is boosting denim sales, and should inspire sales of new tops and shoes to go with them.\\n\\nPutting on the Glitz\\nA return to office life will also fuel more fashion spending. Winser London, which specializes in stylish workwear for women, is seeing demand for more fitted dresses increase as cities open up again. Menswear hasn’t picked up as much, but sales should revive as employers call workers back to headquarters.\\n\\nSmarten Up\\nWhile the rotation in clothing appears well underway, the picture is more complicated in other consumer sectors. In food, for example, restaurants are getting busier, but people are still cooking and ordering a lot at home.\\n\\nNestle SA says it’s seeing demand recover for products used in restaurants, especially in China; at the same time, its Nespresso coffee unit is still benefiting from remote workers being their own baristas. Rekki, a technology platform that connects independent restaurants with food suppliers, has also seen orders rise as the hospitality sector comes back.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\nStarbucks Corp. is starting to see recovery in sales at U.S. shops in dense, urban areas — the type that rely on office workers and tourists. But growth in its home market in the latest quarter was still powered by suburban locations and drive-thru windows, a sign that pandemic routines haven’t yet faded.\\n\\nEat Up\\nThe home improvement category hasn’t changed much yet, but spending on renovations and other projects is expected to slow over time. Now that you’ve built a new shed and extended that loft, you probably won’t be repeating the process anytime soon. Some makeover projects envisioned in lockdown are still underway or awaiting an available contractor, but there will likely be fewer starting as vacations and sports tickets reclaim wallet share.\\n\\nHolidays typically take a large chunk of the family budget. Right now, there’s a lot of uncertainty over international travel and fewer tourists are booking vacations abroad in sunny destinations such as Greece and Spain. (No wonder demand for swimwear is lagging fashion.) But if travel to and around Europe does resume this summer, it will unleash a torrent of spending. Unilever Plc says the performance of its European ice-cream business would be linked to whether people can visit beaches and tourist towns.\\n\\nBeing in the midst of these shifts means retailers and consumer goods groups must keep planning for uncertainty and remain flexible. Strategies will have to take into account the vastly different Covid experiences across regions. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, clothing and food retailers should be ready to increase their supply. In markets still ravaged by the virus, such as India, the emphasis will be on meeting the needs of people who need to isolate, stay at home and recover from the virus.\\n\\nAs the great post-pandemic shift in consumer habits inches along, the old adage that “retail is detail” has never been more appropriate.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNestle SAPandemic ShoppingNespressoUnilever PlcPandemic FashionStarbucks Corp.\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRamesh Shah\\n119 days ago\\nIN INDIA ITS OUT OF SHEER FRUSTRATIONS..\\nVIEW COMMENTS ADD COMMENTS',\n",

In some states like Uttar Pradesh, the lockdowns have been limited to weekends while in others like Delhi and Maharashtra, they have been extended for weeks.\\n\\nIndustry executives fear the government may be forced to impose larger lockdowns given the ferocity with which the virus is spreading and claiming lives across the country. “If there is a larger lockdown, fuel demand will take a heavy hit,” said an oil company executive. “Lower domestic demand would also result in lower refinery runs.”\\n\\nFollowing a sharp recovery in oil demand last year, Indian refiners had started operating at full capacity. The capacity utilisation has again started falling though some refiners are trying to place some of their volumes in the export market.\\n( Originally published on May 01, 2021 )\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nBharat Petroleum Corp.Hindustan PetroleumIndian Oil CorpHindustan Petroleum CorpCoronavirus InfectionsBharat Petroleum\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n2 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRashika Khandelwal\\n119 days ago\\nThe graph attached above showing fuel demand growth has incorrect legends.

Everyone entering the counting venue will have to undergo Thermal Screening, wear Face Masks and Face Shields.\\n\\nThis time, due to Covid-19 protocol, the number of counting tables in each counting hall has been restricted to 7 Tables. This is to maintain social distance inside the Counting Hall. There is an increase of 34.71% in the number of Polling Stations over the number of Polling Stations in the 2016 Assembly Elections.\\n\\nIt is partly due to provision of 5325 numbers of Auxiliary Polling Stations set up in the current elections. Hence, there will be more EVM machines to be counted this time. Accordingly, counting rounds will also increase this time, due to several factors including large number of postal ballots received, counting of VVPAT slips and restricted number of counting tables despite considerable increase in the number of counting halls. Due to these factors, counting of votes will take more time compared to earlier elections. The number of rounds will be varying from minimum around 10 rounds to around 33 rounds for each LAC, depending onthe number of Polling Stations and Counting Tables.\\n\\nEveryone entering the Counting Halls will have to maintain Covid protocol. To maintain Covid protocol, numbers of counting halls have been increased by 131% i.e. from 143 in 2016 Assembly Election to 331 this time.\\n\\nThere will be one Micro Observer at each counting table, who reports directly to the Counting Observer appointed by ECI for every LAC.

       " 'Synopsis\\nRahul Gandhi accused the government of misreading and mishandling the situation and alleged that all early warning signs were ignored, including from scientists.\\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi\\nIn a wide-ranging exclusive interview with PTI, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the entire world is shaken by the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India and there are queues everywhere, whether for oxygen cylinders, for life-saving medicines, for hospital beds and even outside crematoriums. He accused the government of misreading and mishandling the situation and alleged that all early warning signs were ignored, including from scientists. Here is the transcript of the interview:\\n\\nThe second wave of coronavirus has hit India hard. We see people gasping for medical aid, medicines, oxygen. They have no access to facilities in the national capital and across the country. How do you see the situation and the response of the government?\\nIt breaks my heart every single day to wake up to the absolute devastation around us. This is not a wave; it is a tsunami that has destroyed everything in its wake. There are never-ending queues everywhere. There are queues to get an oxygen cylinder, queues to refill the cylinder, queues to get life-saving medicines, queues to get a hospital bed, and now there are queues outside crematoriums. There is a fatal shortage of every single item we need to tackle COVID-19. Our capital\\'s best hospitals are bursting at the seams. We are getting frantic SOS calls for oxygen from India\\'s top doctors. Hospitals are petitioning High Courts for oxygen. Our healthcare workers are seeing patients die in front of their eyes, they cannot save people. India is now the world\\'s coronavirus epicentre. The entire world is shaken by what they are seeing in India. None of this should have happened. There were multiple early warning signs. Forget the signs, scientists clearly warned the government this would happen - they ignored them. We could and should have been much better prepared. And now, where is the government in this crisis? It is completely missing in action. They are obsessed only with saving the Prime Minister\\'s image and blaming others. The new buzzword is that the \\'system\\' has failed. Who is this \\'system\\'? Who runs the \\'system\\'? It\\'s just a ploy to avoid admitting responsibility.\\n\\nDid the government falter in assessing the Covid situation? Who is at fault?\\nAbsolutely. The Prime Minister is at fault. He runs a highly centralised and personalised government machinery, is solely and substantially devoted to building his own brand, is utterly focused on imagery rather than substance. The fact is that this Government completely failed to understand or to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic -- right from the very beginning, despite repeated warnings. Since the very start of this pandemic back in 2020, I kept trying to warn the government about the disaster ahead if we did not urgently prepare but they attacked me and ridiculed me. It\\'s not just me - anyone who tried to sound the alarm, the state callously and thoughtlessly ignored. Modi government let this virus enter India through our airports in February and March of 2020. And then it panicked and without consultation or thought imposed the world\\'s harshest lockdown. Migrant workers were left to fend for themselves and an unprecedented exodus began from the cities. The poorest of the poor were forced to walk hundreds of kilometres home with no support, no aid, no assistance. In his sheer ignorance, the Prime Minister said he would defeat the virus in 21 days, akin to the battle of Mahabharata! Modi government is plainly arrogant and focuses on perception over reality- declaring victory against the virus is absolute insanity and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the nature of what this virus is. The only way to fight corona is with humility and by realizing that you are faced with a relentless opponent, who can adapt and is very resilient. The PM had an entire year to better prepare, protect India, and think through this crisis but what did they do? Did the PM & the Govt add sufficient oxygen capacity, ramp up testing, increase hospital beds, ventilators? Did the PM think long-term about the state of our health infrastructure and start building for the sort of subsequent Corona waves that almost every country in the world was experiencing? It was sheer luck that we emerged out of last year\\'s nightmare, to a point where we had less than 10,000 new cases in a day early in 2021. We were not testing enough then. We are not testing enough now. Where was the preparation for this massive second wave? Why were the jumbo facilities put up last year dismantled? Why did they raise oxygen exports over 700% - think of that number, 700% - in the months before this brutal second wave?\\n\\nWhat could the Government have done differently to address the second wave?\\nThe Modi Government was both grossly negligent and blindly overconfident. The BJP announced the end of the pandemic and congratulated the Prime Minister for his \"success\" even as the second wave was just beginning. The Prime Minister himself is on record as having said that India had successfully fought the pandemic and won. In reality, there was no coherent strategy. One, the government should have built massive capacity over the last year -- testing, oxygen, hospital beds, ventilators. Two, they should not have declared victory prematurely. Three, the Prime Minister and his government did not even acknowledge there was a problem. How can you fix something you don\\'t even accept exists? Four, the government did not act on scientific advice or evidence. They continuously ignored rising cases and were busy instead with election campaigns. They encouraged super-spreader events. They even bragged about them. Our Prime Minister and Home Minister were not even wearing masks in public over the past few months. What sort of a message is that sending to citizens? Five, most importantly, the only solution we have is vaccination. We are supposed to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world. And yet, India is desperately short of vaccines. We are making them, why weren\\'t our people first in line to be vaccinated? If that is not a failure to plan and execute, what is?\\n\\nWith India seeing around 4 lakh cases a day, the highest in the world, is there a case for the national emergency considering the unprecedented crisis?\\nWe are already in the midst of a national emergency. But just declaring something is not the answer. The biggest problem of this government is it announces and then absconds. Now that the situation is completely out of control, they have dropped the ball and thrown it to the states. They have made the states and citizens truly \\'Aatmanirbhar\\'. Rely on yourself is the motto. No one will come to help you. Definitely, not the Prime Minister. The need of the hour is to hold hands, work together and heal our people. India must be the only country in the world facing this massive pandemic without the guidance of an expert and empowered group that is charged with fighting the virus and protecting the people, with planning ahead, anticipating needs and taking the decisions that will result in swift action to save lives.\\n\\nGoI has said it repeatedly warned states about the second wave and asked them to map the need for essential supplies like oxygen, ICU beds, and continue with containment efforts. Would you say the current situation is a collective failure of the Centre and states?\\nThe entire country has already been under the Epidemic Act for more than a year. The Centre has absolute power over states under the Act. This is a government that wants to control everything. When cases went down, they declared victory, and the Prime Minister took all the credit as he always does. Now that the situation is terrible, why are you blaming the states? Out of 162 oxygen plants sanctioned in October by the Centre, only 33 are functional. This was set up with the PM-CARES funds. The Modi Government took tens of thousands of crores of donations in his name, without any transparency, without any accountability. The states have rejected the sub-standard ventilators supplied by the Centre through these funds. States do not even get their GST dues on time. States are dependent on the Modi Government for quotas of oxygen, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections. The Modi Government has chained the hands of the states behind their backs, so they are completely powerless, and then asks them to sort out their own affairs. Obviously, the system will collapse.\\n\\nAdult vaccinations are starting on May 1 along the lines you demanded, but states say they cannot start as they do not have the vaccines. What is your view? Did you seek the expansion of vaccinations too early? The UK will start adult vaccines from June?\\nFirst, the government set a target of vaccinating 300 million by August. This is the above 45 age category. They managed to fully vaccinate not even 2 percent of the total population. With the mounting pressure of the government not vaccinating enough, they added another 600 million to the list, by starting vaccinations for the 18+ group from May 1. But where are the vaccines? Why did the Modi Government abandon the people between age groups of 18 to 44 years by refusing to take responsibility for their vaccination? Why is there a discriminatory policy on the pricing of vaccines? Why should there be five different prices for the same vaccine? What is the strategy beyond two companies? How can that suffice for almost 1 billion people? We need 2 billion doses. Now, they are scrambling for vaccines. The numbers just don\\'t add up.\\n\\nYou have said the liberalised Vaccine policy is discriminatory. Vaccine makers have reduced prices for states. Your comments?\\nThis is the story of \\'discount sale\\', where you mark up the price, and then make a show of reducing it. It is a complete eyewash. Why should states pay more than the Centre to buy vaccines? Why should the states be left to fend for themselves? Why should there be a difference in price for vaccines for the Centre, the States and the private hospitals? Why should the price of the vaccine even for the two companies be different? Why the discrepancy? After all, even when States pay for the vaccination of those between the age groups of 18 to 44 years, it is taxpayer\\'s money.\\n\\nThe government has not invoked compulsory licensing for vaccines despite repeated calls by Congress?\\nDr Manmohan Singh asked for compulsory licensing in his letter to the Prime Minister. The Congress President has repeated it several times now. Other countries have done this. The USA ramped up its vaccine production using their Defense Production Act. We have to do whatever it takes, within our laws, to ramp up the domestic production of vaccines here. We have a domestic manufacturing base. We can manufacture for both India and the world. All the industry needs are licenses and raw materials. It should have been done months ago.\\n\\nThe Congress party has said it is willing to work together with the Centre in the fight against Coronavirus. How will you make it accountable then?\\nCongress Party has said from day one that it is willing to work with the government in the fight against Coronavirus and for a year now, even in just the last few days, the Congress President has repeated this position very clearly. We have been consistently giving suggestions on all possible forums. Forget taking them seriously, the government has not even meaningfully acknowledged these suggestions. I see no contradiction in working together with the government in times of unprecedented crisis while at the same time holding it accountable for its decisions. The problem arises when the government doesn\\'t believe in consultation, in carrying everyone along, in tapping expertise it lacks. This government seems to think that acknowledging help is needed is a sign of weakness. The hubris and pettiness of this government are unbelievable.\\n\\nThe Madras High Court has held the Election Commission responsible for the Covid situation. Your views?\\nThe Court was echoing a widely held view. In the past 7 years, like so many other institutions, the Election Commission of India has also crumbled. The Court has said what it believes, I don\\'t want to make any further comment. Let your readers judge for themselves. Our Institutions are a warning system- they give us feedback and information on how to respond to crisis but our institutions have been completely destroyed and taken over. The press, judiciary, election commission, bureaucracy - none of them have played their role of guardian/watchdog. This means India today is like a ship in a storm, sailing without any information. Corona is just part of the problem - the real problem is that India now doesn\\'t have the capacity to respond to any major crisis because of what has been done to its systems over the last 6 years.\\n\\nThere have been demands within for internal elections and a new Congress president? Are you ready to lead again in such times, especially when there are demands from various quarters within for you to lead?\\nI have always favoured internal organisational elections within the Congress and these will be conducted in time. It is for the party workers to decide as to who should lead the party. I will do whatever the party wants me to do. But right now the focus is on controlling the pandemic, saving lives, and alleviating India\\'s widespread suffering and pain. There will be time for everything else in due course.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRahul GandhiCongress LeadersHospital BedsModi GovtOxygen Supply\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n4 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nGuest Login\\n115 days ago\\nTimepass feku... no actions , no work , no ideas , no inspiration, no brain.... just words words words\\nKish Sh\\n117 days ago\\nWE AS INDIANS ASSURE YOU PROMPT CREMATORIUM AVAILABILITY ASAP ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBLIGE YOU.\\nShyam VS\\n119 days ago\\nWhen the nation is throwing everything it has on the monster, and praying for the best, Mr Gandhi comes to address the nation from his inherited pulpit.

       " 'Synopsis\\nA bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which held a four-hour-long special hearing on a holiday on various issues relating to the COVID-19 situation, said it appears there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes.\\nGetty Images\\nThe Delhi High Court Saturday directed all hospitals in the national capital to provide information on daily admissions and discharge of COVID-19 patients and of those admitted for over 10 days, since April 1. A concern was raised in the court regarding optimal utilisation of ICU and oxygenated beds and ICU beds in hospitals and nursing homes across Delhi.\\n\\nA bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which held a four-hour-long special hearing on a holiday on various issues relating to the COVID-19 situation, said it appears there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes.\\n\\n\"Looking into the dearth and shortage of beds, particularly oxygen beds and beds in ICU, we consider it necessary to have this aspect looked into as there are allegations of malpractice of patients not being discharged despite having recovered from the COVID-19 disease,\" the bench said.\\n\\nIt said, \"We direct the medical superintendents/ owners/ doctors of all hospitals and nursing homes, including those of Delhi government, Centre and private, to place details of the number of COVID-19 patients admitted and discharged each day from April 1.\"\\n\\nThey shall also give details of the number of patients who have remained hospitalised for 10 days or more and the type of bed occupied by them from April 1.\\n\\nThe bench said the details shall be emailed by May 4 to amicus curiae and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao who shall combine the information and place it before the court on May 5.\\n\\nIt also directed the Delhi government to forthwith update its portal about admission and discharge of COVID-19 patients from hospitals and to also keep it updated daily without fail.\\n\\nIt said the number of hospital beds available on the portal shall separately show how many of them are oxygenated and non-oxygenated.\\n\\n\"From what has emerged, it is well known that one who contracts COVID-19, takes about 10-14 days to recover in normal course... about 10 per cent of them require hospitalisation and 1 per cent of the total affected persons are likely to require greater medical intervention and admission to ICU,\" the court noted.\\n\\nDelhi government counsel Satyakam submitted that in Delhi, there are a total of 20,938 beds for COVID-19 patients as on date in all hospitals here and the data include non-oxygenated, oxygenated, ICU beds.\\n\\nTo this, the bench said looking to this number, every day a substantial number of beds should become available for the patients, but that does not appear to be happening.\\n\\nThe patients who require hospitalisation with oxygen support should normally be in a position to leave the hospital within 8-10 days subject to the condition, unless it worsens and requires ICU, the court said, adding that in most cases, COVID-19 resolves itself in 10 days to two weeks with medicines.\\n\\n\"However it appears that there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes,\" the bench said.\\n\\nSenior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, showed an office order by Directorate General of Health Services on the new discharge policy and also a document of the medical director of LNJP Hospital which stated that patients are staying in hospitals beyond seven days.\\n\\n\"\"Therefore, all unit heads and consultants are requested to discharge patients as per the revised discharge policy of the government so that more lives can be saved. Stable patients whose oxygen saturation is more than 91 per cent may be shifted to GNEC, Shehnai banquet and Rouse Avenue School,\" the hospital order said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the court also said hospitals should learn from their experiences regarding oxygen scarcity during the prevailing pandemic and set up plants for generating the life-saving gas.\\n\\nIt said for commercial considerations, some hospitals reduce capital expenditures on things like oxygen plants which are essential in a hospital, especially the big ones, and it is irresponsible not to have such plants.\\n\\nMehra also informed the court that a hospital in the name of Gandhi Hospital on Friday made a false statement that it has not received a single oxygen cylinder for the last 48 hours, despite getting various.\\n\\nThe hospital\\'s owner submitted that there was some mis-communication between the management and their lawyer and there was no intention to make a false statement.\\n\\nThe court warned that such false claims shall not be made in future, particularly at this time as it wastes time and takes away time of the administration which is dealing with the situation on war footing.\\n\\nRegarding a plea by a group of lawyers including Bar Council of Delhi chairman Ramesh Gupta seeking arrangement for treatment of lawyers contracting COVID-19, Mehra said they were working on it and something positive will come up by Monday.\\n\\nAnother plea was mentioned by Dwarka Court Bar Association President Y P Singh seeking to make operation Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka, which has been under construction for the last 8 years and near completion now, which could accommodate 1700 beds.\\n\\nThe court asked the government to take instruction on this and apprise it with the development.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nBar Council Of DelhiCovidCovid PatientsDirectorate General Of Health ServicesDelhi High CourtLnjp Hospital\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe conglomerate said that besides the investment gains, profit also improved at all of its major divisions.\\nAP\\nA year earlier, Warren Buffett's Berkshire reported losing $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per share.\\nRELATED\\nSome little-known facts about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway\\nTopics Warren Buffett may touch upon at the Berkshire AGM today\\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire rebounds from pandemic's depths, buys back more stock\\nOMAHA: Hours before Warren Buffett was set to take the stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, the company on Saturday reported a nearly $12 billion profit in the first quarter a year after a major loss when the value of its stock investments plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway said it earned $11.7 billion, or $7,638 per Class A share, during the first quarter as the paper value of its investment portfolio rebounded. A year earlier, Berkshire reported losing $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per share.\\n\\nThe conglomerate said that besides the investment gains, profit also improved at all of its major divisions - including insurance, utility, railroad, manufacturing and retail companies - as the economy continued to recover from the pandemic during the first three months of this year. But Berkshire said it can't predict how the coronavirus will affect the economy going forward.\\n\\nCFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she was surprised that Berkshire's many economically sensitive businesses didn't improve more given how much the economy has recovered, but that it looked like the company controlled costs well at its major divisions.\\n\\nBuffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings improved to $7.018 billion, or $4,577.10 per Class A share. That's up from $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share a year ago.\\n\\nThe four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings of $3,792.36 per Class A share.\\n\\nBerkshire continued its streak of major stock repurchases by investing $6.6 billion in its own stock during the quarter. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company spent $25 billion on repurchases last year. Seifert said investors will applaud the significant buybacks.\\n\\nBut Berkshire is still sitting on $145.4 billion in cash and short-term investments because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company for several years.\\n\\n``They're just not really putting a lot of capital to work,'' Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said.\\n\\nLater Saturday, Buffett will spend several hours answering questions at an online version of Berkshire's annual meeting. Buffett will be joined by Berkshire vice chairmen Charlie Munger, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.\\n\\nInvestor Cole Smead said Berkshire has largely been sitting on the sidelines in recent years without making major investments, and he'd love to see the company get more active the next time the market swoons. When the pandemic devastated markets a year ago, Berkshire took a cautious approach.\\n\\n``We do not question whether Buffett and Munger have patience. That's obvious. The question is do they have any aggression. That's not obvious,'' Smead said.\\n\\nSeifert said Buffett and Munger may face some tough questions about Berkshire's lack of corporate policies on climate change and social justice issues. Buffett has said he is largely leaving it up to Berkshire's subsidiaries to address those issues.\\n\\n``I think investors have the right to know what their views are on these issues. And so far they have not really been forthcoming at all,'' Seifert said..\\n\\nWhat will be missing at Saturday's meeting will be the thousands of people who normally show up to hear from Buffett and Munger.\\n\\nThis was the second year in a row that Berkshire's meeting was on online-only affair because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year's event was moved outside of Omaha for the first time -- to Los Angeles to be near where the 97-year-old Munger lives.\\n\\nThe meeting usually draws 40,000 to Omaha, filling a 18,300-seat arena and every nearby overflow room. No other company matches those crowds.\\n\\nAuthor Bob Miles said he'll miss ``mingling with like-minded and self-selected shareholders'' and talking with executives who run Berkshire subsidiaries who routinely spend part of the meeting in their company's booth in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall that adjoins the arena. Berkshire companies like Geico insurance, See's Candy and Fruit of the Loom sell their products to shareholders each year.\\n\\nThe fun of the meeting isn't just for shareholders. Jim Weber, who runs Berkshire's Brooks Running, said he longs for the chance to compare notes with fellow Berkshire managers at the one annual event that brings together the leaders of the decentralized conglomerate's dozens of subsidiaries.\\n\\n``We certainly miss that opportunity to connect with our peers,'' said Weber, adding that he would likely watch some of this year's event from a treadmill or stationary bike.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWarren Buffett AGMBerkshire AGMWarren Buffett LiveWarren Buffett AddressWarren BuffettBerkshire Hathaway\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

They plan to build 1,000 such systems in the coming few weeks for various areas including villages. These don’t require electricity.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, IIT-Delhi also donated 110 oxygen cylinders used in various labs to the local administration, said Rao.\\n\\nhas come up with a solution to convert pressure-swing absorption (PSA) nitrogen plants to generate oxygen. It can produce oxygen at a purity level of 93-96%.\\n\\nAlumni from various parts of the world are stepping up, too. A group of five IIT-Kanpur alumni set up a fundraiser called Breathe India to procure oxygen concentrators for Delhi, and managed to raise Rs 2.7 crore in five days. The group now plans to raise another Rs 2-5 crore and has expanded to other cities in UP and Bihar.\\n\\nAnother group comprising two students and an alumnus of IIT-Bombay had started an initiative called HelpNow, which aims to cut the time it takes an ambulance to reach a patient in need.

       " 'Synopsis\\nElection rallies and others may have contributed a small fraction but please look at the totality and context of the overall behaviour seen in the country, even among enlightened sections of people, says Ashutosh Sharma.\\nWhile scientific studies are still on, the strains look more infective, says Ashutosh Sharma.\\nDepartment of Science & Technology secretary Ashutosh Sharma spoke to ET on the second wave of the pandemic, the new strains of the coronavirus, the lessons before us and the role of elections and Kumbh in spreading the infection. Excerpts:\\n\\nOn second wave alerts\\nOur own modelling studies and various other studies, none of them predicted the scale, intensity and the ferocity that we see now. The country was prepared for a surge of less than a lakh per day as a lot of resources were built in the first wave for it.\\n\\nThe ( supermodel) committee gave an informal alert in March and held its last meeting with ( member-health) Dr VK Paul on April 2 where the prediction was of India hitting the peak in the third-fourth week of April with an intensity of less than a lakh per day. Clearly what was predicted was far short of the reality, probably because inputs to the model changed — mutations in the virus which probably required less loading for the disease to take hold.\\n\\nI say clearly that there was no other input, and not one of them, that was an alarming input, as far as science is concerned.\\n\\n\\nand others may have contributed a small fraction but please look at the totality and context of the overall behaviour seen in the country, even among enlightened sections of people. It had become pervasive.\\n\\n\\nI don’t think one can fault the messaging. The messaging was always there. Mathematical models also clearly and emphatically said that the behaviour of the virus was linked to that of the people. It is a difficult situation, we cannot just be blaming each other. The important thing is to take charge of the situation and follow some simple things like masking as well as one can and ensuring adequate ventilation to check the spread of infection.\\n\\n\\nWhile scientific studies are still on, the strains look more infective. It is argued that the transmission is happening through aerosol. It is still under study how much viral load is leading to the onset of disease.\\n\\nComparatively, a small fraction is showing severe symptoms but it is not clear how that selection happens. Comorbidity and obesity are indicators. So was age but now it is shifting to a younger population that was not infected before — like fire to fuel. Several ongoing global studies and at our labs will give greater insight over time.\\n\\n\\nFirst, it educates us about the past. It is now clear if we did not have the lockdown last year, the onset would have been far worse.\\n\\nThe second wave also shows that we must be continuously prepared. We need to seed deep expertise and infrastructure in research, in modelling and crisis response. These are long-term studies that require matching resources as well.\\n\\n\\nWe are working in repurposing of oxygen plants and we have identified several startups and industries for oxygen production. Some new designs have also come up which we are sharing. However, the real bottleneck just now is supply and logistics. That is being addressed by expert groups.\\n\\n\\nWe had no inkling the scale would be so huge. While we were totally prepared, the intensity is too high. This is not in contradiction with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ idea. It is unprecedented scale and the need to supply at speed which is the determining factor here. We should do so (imports) in a crisis. All countries do it.',\n",
       " 'Synopsis\\nThere was initially a joint boycott announcement by the English Football Association, English Premier League, English Football League, Women’s Super League, Women’s Championship as well as player, manager and referee bodies, antidiscrimination group Kick It Out, and the Women In Football group.\\nAgencies\\nThe abuse Tottenham interim coach Ryan Mason received was after he suffered a fractured skull which forced him to retire at age 26 in 2018.\\nThere will be no goal clips, lineup announcements, banter between clubs or even title celebrations. Four days of silence across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram by football leagues, clubs and players in England began on Friday in a protest against racist abuse that has been adopted more widely. Such is the anger across the game, it means that if Manchester City clinches the Premier League on Sunday it will not celebrate the title on social media.\\n\\nWHO IS BOYCOTTING?\\nThere was initially a joint boycott announcement by the English Football Association, English Premier League, English Football League, Women’s Super League, Women’s Championship as well as player, manager and referee bodies, antidiscrimination group Kick It Out, and the Women In Football group. Ahead of the boycott which began at 1400 GMT (1930 IST) on Friday through 2259 GMT on Monday (0430 IST Tuesday), other English sports including cricket, rugby, tennis and horse racing said they would fall silent on social media.\\n\\nFIFA, UEFA and the Premier League’s British broadcasters also said they wouldn’t post online across four days.\\n\\nPrince William, who is president of the FA, said on the Kensington Palace Twitter account he would be joining the boycott. Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, who is the only Black driver on the grid, announced he wouldn’t post during the Portuguese Grand Prix weekend to help “make a difference for future generations.” The International Tennis Federation joined the boycott in the hope it stops vile abusive messages, including death threats, being sent to players, coaches and officials.\\n\\nWHY PROTEST?\\nThe English players’ union led a move to boycott social media for 24 hours in 2019 — called the “Enough” campaign — to demand tougher action to stop hatred being sent online to their members. It hasn’t come, with no zero tolerance. For Facebook-owned Instagram, a racist post isn’t enough to get a user immediately suspended.\\n\\n“It’s dreadful,” said Simone Pound, head of equalities at the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA). “When we first went to them after the Enough campaign I had reams and reams of the examples of the abuse players are receiving. We had (Leicester captain) Wes Morgan in the room talking from a personal level. There was the N-word everywhere, monkey emojis everywhere and they were like, ‘We’re really sorry. It doesn’t contravene our community guidelines.”’\\n\\n\\n\\nNot much has improved after two years, according to Pound. “Since we first met with them, they appreciate that isn’t a good enough response or answer,” Pound said. “However, we are still seeing and know that those words, those emojis are being used in a horrific way, daily to players and they aren’t always being taken down quickly. Sometimes they are still up six months after being reported.”\\n\\nInstagram’s moves to eradicate racism have focused on action against abusive direct messages more than public posts.\\n\\nTWITTER INACTION\\nThe PFA found that 31 out of 56 racist and discriminatory tweets remain live on Twitter as of Thursday despite reporting them last year. Like Facebook, Twitter would not provide anyone for interview to discuss claims they are strengthening moves to remove discriminatory content and abusive users.\\n\\nA study by the anti-discrimination Fare network with Belgium-based artificial intelligence company Textgain found that 157 players involved in the quarterfinals of the Champions League and Europa League last August received discriminatory abuse on Twitter. Six months later, 66% of discriminatory tweets remained online as did 71% of the accounts, Fare said, pointing out that while ethnic minority players receive more racist abuse, there is homophobic abuse sent to players across the game.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT ACTION\\nThe British government is introducing a law to address online safety that could lead to social media companies being fined for failing to crack down on racism. “We could see fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden wrote in Friday’s edition of The Sun newspaper.\\n\\n“For a company such as Facebook or YouTube, that could be billions.”\\n\\nMANAGERS\\nThe boycott started as managers were holding news conferences ahead of the weekend’s matches. Wolverhampton’s Nuno Espirito Santo, the only Black manager in the Premier League, flagged issues about withdrawing from public information platforms.\\n\\n“Not everyone on social media uses it badly,” he said of the boycott. “You’ve to balance and we can’t compromise our freedom, but at the moment I think it’s a good measure.”\\n\\nThe abuse Tottenham interim coach Ryan Mason received was after he suffered a fractured skull which forced him to retire at age 26 in 2018.\\n\\n“I had to zone out of it and had to take myself off social media as a player because I didn’t want to see it,” Mason said. “Even after I retired I’d get messages about my injury and certain things, and you almost think it’s another message and I’ll just ignore it. But these things shouldn’t be acceptable.”\\n\\nBANNED BY CLUBS\\nManchester United announced on Friday that six fans have been banned for racially abusing Tottenham forward Son Heung-min on social media. United also found in a review of Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that 3,300 abusive posts were aimed at their players from September 2019 to February 2021. Chelsea also said that a supporter had been banned for 10 days for antisemitic posts.\\n\\nWHAT’S NEXT?\\nThe PFA is preparing for more blackouts on social media. “I personally feel this could be the first of a series of boycotts,” Pound said. “We can do this every week if we have to. This is not going away. They have to listen to us.”\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nGovernmentUnitedUefaSocial MediaChampions LeaguePremier League\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " 'Synopsis\\nVaccinating all adults, some 90 crore Indians, is fraught with multiple challenges. These include a massive shortage of jabs, friction between the Centre and some states, confusion arising out of differential pricing and, above all, the severity of the current wave, which has jammed the nation’s healthcare infrastructure and even forced many youngsters to worry whether vaccination centres could emerge as super spreading spots.\\nReuters\\nAfter Nayana Achamma, a BA student in Kerala, cast her vote for the first time on April 6, she has been all agog to know the results of the assembly elections which will be out on May 2. But closer to the date, the anticipation for the results got supplanted by her eagerness for the Covid-19 vaccine, which opened for all adults from May 1.\\n\\n“Right now, I just want to get the vaccine as fast as possible,” says the 18-year-old. “The second wave has returned with a lot more intensity. The sooner we get the vaccine, the better, right?” she reasons. When registrations opened for everyone above 18 years on the at 4 pm on April 28, Achamma was able to register after multiple attempts but to her disappointment, did not get a slot. “I’ll try again,” she says.\\n\\nOn May 1, the day vaccination took off, only a few states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat could start the process, that too, symbolically, in a few districts. Most states missed the launch against a gloomy backdrop of acute vaccine shortage and a second surge of Covid-19 that has turned lethal, not sparing the younger lot, either.\\n\\nTill now, barely 2% of India’s 1.35 billion population — mainly healthcare and security personnel plus some senior citizens — have got both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccines. Only this tiny proportion is somewhat shielded from the brutal new wave that has plunged entire cities and villages in despair and mourning. About 100 million, i.e. less than 8% of the population, have taken only one dose. In the last 24 hours India saw over 4 lakh Covid cases, the highest single-day spike globally, and 3,523 deaths.\\n\\n\\nUnquestionably, at this juncture, vaccines are the basic armour against the virus and mass inoculation is the need of the hour. The very fact that 133 million citizens registered on the Co-WIN portal on April 28, the day people in the 18-44 years age cohort was permitted to enrol, demonstrates how younger Indians are willing and eager to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. However, vaccinating all adults, some 90 crore Indians, is fraught with multiple challenges. These include a massive shortage of jabs, friction between the Centre and some states, confusion arising out of differential pricing and, above all, the severity of the current wave, which has jammed the nation’s healthcare infrastructure and even forced many youngsters to worry whether vaccination centres could emerge as superspreading spots.\\n\\nCardiac surgeon and chairman of Medanta, , argues that hospitals still have enough capacity, appealing young Indians with no symptoms to come forth and get themselves vaccinated as early as possible. “Unlike the last time, the number of younger people who got infected and even died during this wave is out of proportion. I would like the younger lot to get vaccinated soon. Self-defence includes wearing a mask and getting vaccinated,” says Trehan, adding that the impact of the virus on those who have already got two shots is milder.\\n\\nShobana Kamineni, executive vicechairperson of , echoed a similar view when ET spoke to her last week. “The more we vaccinate, the less will be the problem. The pandemic has to be tamed just like a forest fire. Right now, the fire is everywhere. Once more and more people get vaccinated and acquire immunity, there will only be small eruptions here and there, and only those need to be clamped down,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is evident that scaling up of vaccination will alleviate the problem although it cannot immediately arrest the exploding number of cases as it takes time for immunity to build. The question is: How soon can India do that? Does India have enough vaccines to cover everyone above 18? In an email reply to ET’s queries, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), says his company is scaling up production capacity from the present level of 60-70 million doses per month. “By July we hope to produce 100 million doses monthly,” he says. SII has been manufacturing Covishield, one of the two vaccines currently in use in India, the other being Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.\\n\\nTo the question of SII’s commitment to states and private hospitals, Poonawalla replies he can’t share specific details at this juncture. “As per the recent GoI directive, 50% of our capacity will be reserved for the Union government and the remaining 50% will be for state governments and private hospitals. That said, at this stage, it would be difficult to share specific details.”\\n\\nMost states are aware they won’t receive adequate vaccine supplies to cater to the new demand. While BJP-ruled states are largely silent on the matter, those ruled by other parties, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, have openly expressed their anger and apprehension, saying they don’t have enough stocks. Nor have they received any firm commitment or timeline from suppliers to cover the age cohort of 18-44, they say. This is even as private hospital chains like Apollo, Fortis and Max began vaccination for this age group on May 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you probe a little more, the friction between the Centre and states comes to the fore. States that are not ruled by the BJP are worried about the possibility of the Centre taking the entire credit for the exercise even as it washes its hands of it and makes the states contribute to the cost of vaccines for 18-44-year-olds.\\n\\nHealth Minister of Chhattisgarh, TS Singh Deo, minces no words when he says: “It is petty to say so, but the certificate coming out of Co-WIN portal will have the prime minister’s photo. However, for vaccinating 18-plus, states will also pay. Our state, for example, is paying some Rs 1,000-1,200 crore. We wanted our own portal, but the Centre has not agreed to our proposal.” Chhattisgarh has placed an order for 25 lakh doses of Covishield and an equal quantity of Covaxin.\\n\\nVaccine supplies for the new phase have become more complicated with the Centre announcing that states will have to procure doses for the 18-44 years cohort directly from manufacturers. Vaccine makers have been instructed to reserve half the output for the Centre and the remaining doses for states and the private sector, with differential pricing for each. This is in contrast with the Union government’s policy on universal immunisation until now, with the Centre buying the doses and distributing it among the states. “All these decades, the central government always procured vaccines and supplied them to the states. Due to its huge market, India always got very competitive prices. In fragmented markets and at a time when the product is scarce and demand is high, the seller is at a huge advantage,” says K Sujatha Rao, former secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.\\n\\nAdditionally, to have 30 states enter into individual contracts, ensure supplies and do quality assurance checks would be duplication with no advantage and end up wasting huge amounts of time for overworked health departments, she argues Then there is the vexing issue of pricing, with the manufacturers announcing different prices for the Centre, states and the private sector. Vaccines that are directly imported, by private players or states, will be priced separately. Uttar Pradesh, for example, has announced that it would float a global tender to import 40 million doses.\\n\\n\\nIndian manufacturers have announced the price list. One dose of Covaxin will be sold for Rs 1,200 to private hospitals, Rs 400 to states and for Rs 150 to the Centre. As far as Covishield is concerned, SII is charging Rs 600 from private hospitals, Rs 300 from states and Rs 150 from the Centre.\\n\\n“A business that is in the business of earning profits will sell to one offering a higher price, in this case the private parties. So where do the states stand in the queue?” asks Rao. Considering India has so far practised equitable vaccination with the government procuring the vaccine for all government entities, there was no reason to deviate from that now, she says. “The private sector, if it so wishes, can collaborate with the government and provide the vaccine at a nominal fee or buy vaccines in India and abroad and make a variety available for those who can afford those prices,” she says.\\n\\nSII’s Poonawalla argues that charging higher rates from select customers is important as he would need more resources for ramping up the production capacities of his factories: “The initial supply price of Covishield for government programmes, including in India, has been the lowest. Private market price is 3-4 times higher. This is partly due to large volumes and because a majority of the population gets vaccinated for free through the government. We must, however, be able to sustain and reinvest in scaling up our capacity and save lives.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, India Inc has begun purchasing vaccines directly. ITC, for example, has decided to support all its eligible employees and their family members with vaccination under the company’s medical assistance policy, with support for vaccination also being extended to service providers and partners in the value chain across the country, according to Amitav Mukherji, head of the corporate human resources of the company.\\n\\nDr Satyajit Rath, an immunologist with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune, warns that vaccination will not have an immediate effect on the current, ongoing surge – “that will play out over the next few weeks since it takes at least three weeks after a vaccine dose for people to acquire any immunity”. “Covid-19 vaccine reduces the chances of catching infection, but does not make it zero, and reduces the chances of dying of Covid-19 even more, but does not make even that zero,” he adds, emphasising that there should be clear, sober messaging on vaccination.\\n\\nHowever, the biggest challenge now is simply the lack of supply of adequate doses of vaccines. While India produces about 80 million doses a month of Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines which have received emergency use authorisation, public health professionals say the situation will only exacerbate with the expansion of vaccination drive. “Neither Serum Institute nor Bharat Biotech will have adequate supplies in May. We have raised expectations and demand without sufficient supply — that’s going to hit state governments in a big way, unless they come out and say they are not going to start in May and that they will do so in June or July,” says Dr N Devadasan, who has worked in public health for over three decades and is currently a technical advisor to Health Systems Transformation Platform, set up by Tata Trusts.\\n\\nDr Rath, too, cautions against raising expectations at a time of severe shortage of vaccines. “Vaccination campaigns need to ensure the reliability of vaccine availability; the current situation of uncertainty where people make online appointments which are cancelled at the last moment or worse, end up with no vaccine supply at the centres, increase vaccine hesitancy. Not much may be promised, but what is promised needs to be delivered,” he says. With supplies likely to change from week to week, Dr Rath says states’ decision-making around the vaccine drive must be dynamic and flexible to accommodate this. He suggests that states must include in priority groups those at risk of serious outcomes of infection (such as the elderly and those with co-morbidities) and those with a high likelihood in major transmission points.\\n\\n\\nThe current vaccine policy could lead to inequity as well, as larger states might be able to negotiate a better price than others, says Dr Devadasan. “You could end up having huge variations among states. Also, some states have announced that they will give vaccines for free while others have not — will the latter be charging patients? That could then be a significant amount.” The Union government, he says, must intervene because vaccines are a public good.\\n\\n\\nGlobally, governments have been providing Covid vaccines to residents for free, including in the United States. Indonesia is one of the few countries which has allowed its private sector to pursue a separate plan to procure doses and launch vaccine drives but even there, companies cannot make employees pay for it. Though some people might be reluctant to risk infection by stepping out to get the vaccine, Dr Rath says chances of infection in a hospital or vaccination centre are less simply because masking and related rules are strictly enforced. “The locations where the infection is likely being transmitted are households and small social gatherings and marketplaces where masking and physical distancing are not well maintained.”\\n\\n\\nAnother hurdle in maximising vaccination, say experts, is the clause that 18-44-yearolds have to mandatorily register online. Dr Prashanth NS, a faculty member at the Institute of Public Health, says that in the previous phases, nearly everyone who came to get vaccinated at primary health centres in and around BR Hills in Karnataka’s Chamarajanagar district — the predominantly rural and tribal region where he is based — walked in, without prior registration. “Once you say registration is required, that will be a huge exclusionary barrier for several people who are more in need of the vaccine than others,” he says.\\n\\nIt’s meaningless to argue that there is high penetration of smartphones in rural areas because that does not immediately mean an ability to register and use apps. In and around BR Hills, for instance, Prashanth says there has not been much enthusiasm for the vaccine — in that context, the additional barrier of online registration will only hamper immunisation efforts. “Never in the history of our country have we required registration for vaccination. We’ve done vaccination very well with ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife) — why are we not leveraging that, instead of using apps?” he asks.\\n\\nOne concern flagged by Dr V Ravi, virologist and former professor at NIMHANS, is the low uptake of vaccination among elders. States, he suggests, could continue with the previous strategy of prioritisation, in the face of supply constraints. “At least 80% of elders should be saturated first, then those with co-morbidities and, finally, the youngsters.” This has been the strategy followed by countries like the UK where vaccination was finally opened to those below the age of 50 years in descending order of age after everyone in the priority category had got at least one dose.\\n\\nIn India, since the rollout of vaccines in mid-January, the jab graph formed humps with occasional falls in between due to supply shortage, festivals and the recent surge of Covid cases. With the rising Covid numbers and deaths in places like Delhi, the graph is worrying. It’s likely that the newly eligible cohort of 18-44 years will propel the jab graph northward once more. After all, vaccines are one ray of hope for Indians battling the pandemic.',\n",

He has put in a system after a lot of effort, but the administration on the ground has ruined it. District administrations are proving to be a failure”.\\n\\nHe said that after his communication, the tehsil administration has pulled up its socks and efforts are on now to bring the oxygen situation under control in the next couple of days, at least in Gola.\\n\\nLaw minister Brijesh Pathak was the first one to direct the state administration’s attention to the failing situation in Lucknow in terms of lack of bed and delays in medical care.\\n\\nBJP MP from Mohanlalganj Kaushal Kishore is also increasingly vocal about the on-ground chaos –– from highlighting how oxygen suppliers were not being supplied to private hospitals to directing the CM’s attention towards laxities being observed by prominent government hospitals in Lucknow to requesting the to postpone the panchayat elections that have allegedly claimed the lives of more than 700 teachers who were on duty.\\n\\nSimilarly, Meerut MP, Rajendra Agarwal had written to the CM about the glaring shortage of oxygen in the district which was preventing hospitals to accept new patients.\\n\\nEarlier this week, BJP MLA from Aurai, Bhadohi, Dinanath Bhaskar, wrote a letter to the CM calling for a probe into the Covid-related death of the BJP district secretary of Bhadohi. The leader passed away on April 27 in a government hospital in Bhadohi.

The rollout of the new phase began in certain pockets in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Odisha and in select centres of private hospital chains Apollo Hospitals, Max Healthcare and Fortis Healthcare.\\n\\nIn Mumbai, 1,000 people were inoculated, the target set by the city’s civic body, with this number to be raised to 2,500 on Sunday. “We decided to vaccinate 200 people from the 18-44 age category today at five centres and we have fully achieved this target. Each centre was supposed to vaccinate 200 people,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI.\\n\\nVaccination for this phase is only through prior registration with walk-ins disallowed. In New Delhi, Max Healthcare had said the drive would begin at some of its hospitals even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had made it clear the national capital would not join the rollout on Saturday as doses had not arrived. Apollo Hospitals sources told PTI that the immunisation at its hospitals in Delhi was likely to begin by Monday or Tuesday.\\n\\nThe Uttar Pradesh government began the “Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3” vaccinations in seven districts which had clocked over 9,000 Covid-19 cases each - Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Bareilly. Gujarat kicked off the new phase in 10 districts most affected by the pandemic, including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Gandhinagar.\\n\\nThe drive was launched in a limited number of districts as Gujarat has received only three lakh doses from the vaccine manufacturers as against the order of 2.5 crore doses placed by the state government, officials told PTI. Authorities in Ahmedabad said they have set up 76 vaccination centres. The rollout starts at a time when many states are reporting a shortage of vaccines though the Centre’s report available till 8 am on Saturday says over 79 lakh Covid vaccine doses are still available with the states and Union Territories to be administered.\\n( Originally published on May 01, 2021 )\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUddhav ThackerayKarnatakaMaharashtraSerum Institute Of IndiaBharat BiotechVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",
       " 'Synopsis\\nRobert O. Mendelsohn teaches environmental economics at Yale University.\\nET Bureau\\nRobert O. Mendelsohn teaches environmental economics at Yale University. Speaking to ET, he discusses President Joe Biden’s 2030 timeline for the US to halve its greenhouse gas emissions, the likely impacts of climate change on India — and the importance of global synergy in climate mitigation schemes:\\n\\nPresident Biden has announced a 2030 target for the US to halve its emissions — which American industries are likely to change most rapidly?\\nThis depends on the programs President Biden can actually implement — his first target will be to incentivise American utilities to go as carbon-free as possible by 2030. His second target will be transportation. However, this is a much more difficult sector to wean away from oil, gasoline and diesel than power as these fuels are much cheaper relatively for transport. Switching to electricity-based transportation will be more expensive and harder to accomplish. Major emitters in manufacturing will also be affected. But President Biden’s overall chances of success will be tied to the cooperation he gets from the legislature which wi l l need to support more efficient mitigation mechanisms like carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes.\\n\\nWhat is your assessment of the economic impacts of climate change on India?\\nMy research indicates that the bulk of global climate damages will bear down worryingly on low latitude countries like India. Countries like India which are closer to the equator could endure up to 80% of the global damage of climate impacts. The primary reason therefore to think of climate change as a global challenge is to help reduce the damage in such countries. Ironically, it’s hard to convince many countries to invest in climate mitigation because they don’t want to spend on something that seems to benefit another nation — this behaviour makes it harder to stop climate change.\\n\\nAgencies\\n\\nWhat are some recommendations you’d make to developed economies on mitigating global climate change?\\nI would first suggest establishing a carbon tax on emissions. This should be taxed at around ten dollars a ton of carbon. It should apply to main emitters and most mid-to high latitude economies, which are not going to be as hard hit by climate impacts, would thereby have to spend more on mitigation. Some countries are very poor and it would be unfair to burden them with the extra costs of climate mitigation. The world should help poorer households in those countries pay their share of mitigation costs — the energy expenditures of a poor household can be estimated and richer groups can increase climate aid to compensate for the higher costs of their moving to clean energy.\\n\\nThe science is extremely clear. Why are there still so many roadblocks in the path of mitigating climate change?\\nThere are two main reasons. Firstly, most mitigation schemes are still very expensive. And as much as most people would like to see climate change disappear, they are not willing to make a sacrifice to do this. Mitigations do require sacrifices in terms of lifestyles, profits, investments into renewables and so on. The second reason is that climate change is a global problem and not a national one. Even if India were to make huge reductions in its emissions, that won’t change the climate situation of India — it is only if the entire world were to make huge reductions that India’s climate situation would change. We don’t have global governance for this. Yet, this needs good global decisions.\\n\\nThe situation calls for a different approach now. I’d like to see every country do something about their own emissions — each nation should intensively research how it can reduce emissions inexpensively. Each country should establish a national carbon reduction target and find affordable solutions to reach this. That would be a practical start. The problem is that climate change is often approached by envisioning dramatic mitigation steps — but these are very expensive, so, in fact, few people want to carry these out. Most people in reality end up doing nothing at all. But there are also relatively affordable mitigations that will help us get started. To solve global climate change, we need a realistic middle ground between wanting to do nothing and trying to do too much.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nYale UniversityJoe BidenClimate MitigationEmissionsCarbon Tax\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\nANI\\nCOVID-19 CASES\\nWorld\\nIndia\\nConfirmed\\n32,695,030\\nDeaths\\n437,830\\nJaspreet Rai is desperately trying to do her part for the country she left more than 30 years ago: help its people breathe.\\n\\nRai, 53, who moved to Endicott, New York -- the birthplace of IBM -- from Punjab, in India, is the founder of Sanrai International, a provider of oxygen concentrators. With India now the epicenter of the pandemic, counting about 3,500 Covid-19 deaths daily, and oxygen supplies running out, Rai has rushed to help her former homeland cope with its worst crisis in recent history.\\n\\n“This is probably the hardest time they’re going through,” Rai said of her 100-strong staff on the ground, who will supply 30,000 units across India in May, several times the 1,500 Sanrai normally provides in a year. “When you don’t have equipment, and you’re trying to hold people, and they’re gasping, literally gasping for air. And you’re like, look, I’ve sold my last unit, I have to wait until the next stock comes in.”\\n\\nLike Rai, millions of Indians spread across the globe -- one of the world’s largest diasporas -- are trying to do what they can to help their country of origin as heart-wrenching images of people lining up for oxygen cylinders, waiting outside hospitals for a bed or huddling around funeral pyres flash across their screens. Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\n\\nThe number of daily new coronavirus cases in India on Saturday topped the 400,000 mark for the first time, pushing the total infections to more than 19 million. That milestone was crossed on a day when the nation opened its vaccination program to all adults.\\n\\nFeeling Helpless\\nThe diaspora is collecting funds, lobbying governments in countries where they reside and making pledges to shuttle essential supplies and equipment. But the scale of the task is leaving many feeling helpless as the health-care infrastructure in the world’s second-most populous country teeters on the brink of collapse.\\n\\n“They need doctors and hospitals,” said Venktesh Shukla, general partner at Monta Vista Capital in Silicon Valley. “I’ve been struggling for the last three to four days to figure out what to do. Like a lot of Indians, we want to do something. We just can’t find a short-term solution to help.”\\n\\nIn spite of that frustration, the need to “do something” in the face of the unfolding tragedy is spurring many into action.\\n\\nLike Sudhir Ravi. Little did Ravi know he would be embarking on a humanitarian mission when the Chicago-based private equity boutique TJM Capital Partners, where he is an operating partner, bought the largest U.S. supplier of military-grade oxygen generators in a strategic acquisition in April.\\n\\nBut with Covid raging, Ravi soon identified 11 industrial strength oxygen concentrators between the U.S. and Germany that can be distributed to hospitals in India. The devices can offer oxygen to 50,000 people in the next six months.\\n\\nFor the last week, he and Raghu Gullapalli, a close contact and executive director at the LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, have been frantically looking for ways to get them to India, requesting the services of Amazon and FedEx. A consortium of Indian philanthropists have committed to cover the $100,000 cost of shipment, and Ravi said they’re hoping to get the cargo in the air on May 5.\\n\\n“Right now, time is measured in lives,” said Gullapalli.\\n\\nBillionaire Action\\nIndian-born billionaires and executives are also piling in with help. Tech investor Vinod Khosla tweeted that he’s willing to send supplies by the “planeload.” Google, headed by Sundar Pichai, promised $18 million in cash assistance to victims’ families and medical equipment. Microsoft Corp., led by CEO Satya Nadella, pledged to draw on the company’s network to provide essential supplies.\\n\\nIn the U.K., home to around two million Indians, aid has come from people like steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Karan Bilimoria, who helped draw support from companies as the first Indian head of the Confederation of British Industry.\\n\\n“We are focused on getting this help that is desperately needed as quickly as possible,” said Bilimoria, whose company produces Cobra beer, a staple of Indian restaurants in the U.K. Air Liquide SA, the French gas supplier that helps create the bubbles in Bilimoria’s beer, has pledged its oxygen production in India to support Covid patients.\\n\\nMittal’s Indian operations are providing 210 metric tons of liquid oxygen a day. “Helping the people of India means helping India, and that’s crucial for the entire world,” he said in an emailed statement.\\n\\nThe charitable foundation of U.K.-based billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought supermarket chain Asda, donated 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) to four hospitals in the western Indian state of Gujarat, from where their family hails.\\n\\nVaccine Woes\\nAs life in the U.K. and the U.S. edges ever closer to pre-pandemic normal, for Indians abroad worrying about family and friends, the unequal access to vaccines is becoming evident. Only 2% of the people in India have been fully vaccinated compared with 30% in the U.S. and 21% in the U.K., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.\\n\\nMonta Vista’s Shukla said he and 60 other influential Indians lobbied to convince the Joe Biden administration to free up vaccine supplies and steroids. The U.S. has decided to start shipping drugs like AstraZeneca’s vaccine and Remdesivir to India.\\n\\nYet for all that, there’s only so much even powerful Indians can do remotely as raw material and equipment shortages, freight delays and labor limits hamper efforts on the ground.\\n\\n“There’s only so many oxygen concentrators available in the market,” said Jitesh Gadhia, a British politician and a trustee of the British Asian Trust who has helped lead the U.K. government’s response and engagement with suppliers. “I am concerned that so many people trying to buy a limited stock will just raise prices. What we need is more supply.”\\n\\nAnd that won’t be easy. While in Endicott Rai is trying to find charter flights to get around bottlenecks to transport her oxygen concentrators to India from China, she said units her company can provide in a month “could probably just be used in one day.”\\n\\nRai, who started her company after her asthmatic grandmother died in 2008 needing oxygen, said she’s saddened by the continued fight in India over something as essential as the air one breathes.\\n\\n“I couldn’t understand how something so basic as oxygen was so complicated,” she said. “And that question is what I’ve been trying to answer for the past 13 years.”\\n\\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin and Gina Turner.\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAmazonCovidIBMRaviCoronavirusGoogleRemdesivirPandemic\\n9 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nZillionaire\\n119 days ago\\nWonderful and very creditable.

The investment companies technically fall under the definition of ‘deemed ’ - and will hence be regulated by RBI.\\n\\nMost HNIs use investment vehicles to invest their personal wealth in an array of investments. Many hold equities in some of their listed companies through investment arms. “Some investment companies set up by ultra-rich HNIs for investments in listed and unlisted space fall under the definition of ‘deemed NBFCs’ and are regulated by the RBI,” said , managing partner at law firm SNG & Partners. “Most of these companies neither borrow a single penny nor lend money to third parties.”\\n\\nSeveral corporate and individuals have undertaken massive restructuring exercises to avoid being regulated by the central bank. As per the RBI data, there are 64 companies registered as CIC, including companies owned by Tatas, Aditya Birla, and . Mails sent to Tata group, Aditya Birla group, Bharti Airtel and JSW on Thursday did not elicit any response as of press time Friday. Apart from these 64 companies, most promoters and investors who have not registered their investment arms with the RBI will also be impacted.\\n\\nRBI has put certain conditions for considering any company as an NBFC even if it’s not into lending. These include if a company holds 90% of its assets in the form of equity shares and its asset size is more than Rs 100 crore. “Many HNIs had invested through companies and the net worth of these companies had skyrocketed in the last one year, resulting in them falling under a de-facto definition of NBFC,” said Uday Ved, partner at tax advisory firm KNAV. “These companies will now have to be restructured in a way that they do not fall under the technical definition of a deemed NBFC, but in all practical purposes these companies are not NBFCs.”\\n\\nThe fear is that if RBI was to regulate these investment arms, then this could lead to legal complications. In most cases, promoters want to make sure that either they restructure the investment arms as non-companies or add additional layering so that it doesn’t technically become a CIC. Many investors who have not registered their companies with the RBI are not aware that their investment arms are now technically NBFCs, legal experts said.\\n\\nWhile the impact is on large investors, the spurt in the stock markets in the last one year also means that several investors have seen their investment arms cross the Rs 100-crore mark, experts said.',\n",

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan-an anti-Pakistan militant group-was weakened by leadership losses, but recently announced its reunification with two splinter groups to bolster its capabilities,\" he said.\\n\\n\"While Pakistani intelligence continues to provide material support and safe haven to the Taliban, Islamabad continues to support Afghan peace efforts, encouraging the Taliban to engage in dialogue with the Afghan Government,\" he added.\\n\\nBerrier said that Pakistan\\'s relations with India continue to remain tense since New Delhi\\'s August 2019 revocation of Kashmir\\'s semiautonomous status.\\n\\nDuring the year, tensions with India probably will remain elevated, and concerted efforts by both sides to fully implement the February 25, 2021 ceasefire will be necessary to reduce tension along the Line of Control.\\n\\nPakistan perceives nuclear weapons as key to its national survival, specifically to counter the threat from India\\'s growing conventional force superiority, and likely will increase its nuclear stockpile in 2021.\\n\\nTo that end, Pakistan continues to modernise and expand its nuclear capabilities by conducting training with its deployed weapons and testing developmental missiles.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNarendra ModiIndian ArmyIndian NavyTalibanLine Of ControlForeign PolicyIndia\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n5 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nMuthukrishna Pitchumani\\n118 days ago\\nInsteasd of Modi if congo regime had been there, xiping would have been our present indian prime minister, india every part from north to south one by one, for filling congi coffers, being sold to PLA under MOU from Congi under the able leadership of Pappu and PC, keeping hundreds of more crores in virgin islands.\\nValerian Pereira\\n119 days ago\\nwhen the U.N and the world body is just watching..The aggressor.. trespassing our LAC..LAxman Rekha what are we expected to do?Its about time that inndia too work on Cber..AI..All High tech..defense projects and defend our Land and also protect the International communityas these big guys simply..walk into an Annexe what they want.where they wantHow?why?Time to be extremely Aggressive. and put the enemy in place.\\nBadri Vinayak\\n120 days ago\\n4 chinese soldiers?

The stock goes straight to hospitals from the distributors under supervision of the state government. In this chain of supply, the chemists are not involved, so they can\\'t be blamed for hoarding.\"\\n\\nElaborating on a large scale requirement of life saving drugs for critical Covid patients, Rajiv Singhal said that taking note of daily cases of around 3.75 lakh in India, at least 70,000 patients would need a Remdesivir injection. \"As each patient requires 6 vials, the country would need over 4 lakh Remdesivir injections every day. We hope as most manufacturers have ramped up their production, the crisis of short supply of Remdesivir would be over,\" the General Secretary of AIOCD added. According to him, other medicines like Fabiflu and Tocilizumab were also in shortage due to sudden surge in demand. In many cases stock is not reaching chemists. Besides there were problems in procuring raw material for manufacturing Fabiflu which comes from abroad.\\n\\nOn shortage of Betadine gargle, recommended for prevention of Covid-19 by many doctors, Rajiv Singhal said that due to a surge in demand of Betadine, its manufacturing company could not meet the present requirement of the market. \"Let me tell you, people who need one bottle of Betadine, now buy 4 bottles. Everyone who can afford, wants to store such drugs. Actually this type of mindset of storing crucial medicines at home, is the reason behind the present shortage of certain medicine since the past one month.

With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Pfizer Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAbout 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts\\' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.\\n\\nSome strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\n\"The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that\\'s because you\\'re seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there\\'s still more room,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\\n\\nThe high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.\\n\\nCiting stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index was last at about 4,180.\\n\\nStocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.\\n\\nEarnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.\\n\\nHowever, \"tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That\\'s what I find amazing,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.\\n\\n\"Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,\" he said. Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard, Cummins Inc, ConocoPhillips and Pfizer Inc .\\n\\nThe first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.\\n\\nValue has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index is up about 8% in that time.\\n\\nTechnology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Apple Inc at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\nTech is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.\\n\\nWhile the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.\\n\\n\"It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\\n\\n\"We\\'re actually carving out a third group ... defensives,\" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWall Street OutlookConocoPhillipsRefinitivPfizerJPMorgan Chase & CoPfizer IncWells Fargo Investment InstituteApple IncCredit Suisse Securities\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\nBy John Kemp\\n\\nLONDON: The US Federal Reserve has signalled it will tolerate faster inflation for a time to cement the post-pandemic recovery and boost employment, but the side effect is likely to be a faster rise in commodity prices.\\n\\nThe central bank appears anxious to avoid a repeat of the slow expansion and job gains that followed the financial crisis of 2008 by adopting a more aggressive approach to stimulating the recovery.\\n\\nIn March, non-farm employment was still down by more than 8 million jobs compared with its pre-pandemic peak in February 2020, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving a large jobs gap to be filled.\\n\\nAfter its latest meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed it will seek to achieve the twin objectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run.\\n\\nThe committee noted price rises have been running persistently below target, so it aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time to make up the shortfall and anchor expectations at around the 2% level.\\n\\nBut if the Fed leaves rates low to target the slackest part of the economy - the labour market - it must intensify pressure on capacity and prices in other parts of the economy, including manufacturing and raw materials.\\n\\nINFLATION AVERAGING\\nProposals for medium-term inflation-averaging have been winning adherents for some years, but the committee appears to be planning something more ambitious - an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\n\\nThe plan is to run the economy hot to achieve faster job gains, especially among disadvantaged groups that are marginally attached to the labour force, before shifting back to inflation control later in the cycle.\\n\\nBut the resulting pressure on global supply chains while the Fed pursues employment increases is likely to generate significantly quicker price rises for raw materials and a range of manufactured items.\\n\\nBased on breakeven rates, bond traders are anticipating US consumer prices will rise at an average rate of 2.4% over the next ten years, compared with a realised average of 1.7% per year over the last decade.\\n\\nFor much of the last decade, expected inflation has been higher than the outturns, implying traders tend to overestimate price pressures.\\n\\nBut bond traders are probably correct for now, reacting to signs the Fed is prepared to tolerate significantly faster inflation to achieve faster employment gains.\\n\\nIS THERE AN UNDERSHOOT?\\nIn its statement, the Fed repeated its previous concerns about a persistent undershoot in the inflation rate, but there is no evidence for this, at least not since the middle of the last decade.\\n\\nPrice levels and inflation rates show no significant lasting impact from the coronavirus epidemic and recession in 2019, in contrast to the prolonged fall after the recession in 2008/09 and the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.\\n\\nConsumer prices have risen at an average rate of just over 2% per year over the last two years, three years and five years, according to the all-items consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nThe only evidence for a persistent undershoot is the 1.7% increase over the last ten years, influenced by unusually slow price increases between 2013 and early 2016.\\n\\nBased on the all-items consumer price index, both the rate of inflation and the level of consumer prices are in line with their long-term trend, and there is no undershoot to make up.\\n\\nThe Fed prefers more specialised measures of inflation, including the deflator for personal consumption expenditures, which is part of the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nPCE inflation has been running at 1.6-1.8% per year over the last two, three and five-year periods, and as little as 1.5% over the last ten years, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nBut PCE inflation has been below 2% almost continuously since 2014, so if the Fed wants to make up for all that undershooting, it implies much faster price increases for an extended period.\\n\\nTIGHT SUPPLY CHAINS\\nThe problem with the Fed’s new inflation averaging strategy is that it fails to specify the historical baseline from which deviations are being measured.\\n\\nWhen exactly did consumer prices move below their desired level and how much of that deviation does the central bank want to reverse and over what time horizon?\\n\\nThe lack of clarity is probably intentional since it gives the central bank flexibility to interpret if the target has been achieved and when to start tapering its bond-buying programme and raising interest rates.\\n\\nBut the strategy strongly suggests the central bank has a relatively high tolerance for faster inflation at the moment and wants to allow the economy to run hot, creating lots of jobs, for a long period.\\n\\nWith the Fed focused on maximum employment creation, it is almost inevitable global supply chains and manufacturing systems will remain stretched, generating upward pressure on goods prices and raw materials.\\n\\nNot since the 1960s has the Fed been so intensely focused on employment, when there was strong growth in output, but which eventually ended with a sharp acceleration in inflation at the end of the decade and in the 1970s.\\n\\nFor the central bank, the hope is that running the economy hot will encourage investment in additional capacity in the manufacturing and commodities sectors, creating jobs and dampening price increases over time.\\n\\nThere is a fine line between running hot and overheating, and if the central bank ends up on the wrong side, there will eventually have to be painful interest rate increases to tackle it.\\n\\nIn the meantime, high levels of consumer and business spending are likely to keep most commodities in short supply through 2021 and 2022, keeping upward pressure on raw materials and manufacturing prices.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUS Consumer PricesCommodity PricesTight SupplyUS Federal ReserveEconomyFederal Open Market CommitteeUS Bureau Of Economic AnalysisInflation\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

BJP will win 70 seats while its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) will suffer reverses and will settle for just eight seats. BJP in Assam had set a target of winning 100 plus seats for the assembly polls of 2021. Most exit polls have hinted at BJP retaining power in Assam. “BJP on its own will get a majority and will win 70 seats, while its ally AGP will win eight seats, United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) will win five seats,” Assam BJP president Ranjit Kumar Dass told media persons in Guwahati.\\n\\n“Together with allies, we will get 83 seats in the 126-member assembly. There are 21 seats which are doubtful, and we are expecting from these seats we will garner at least three seats and our tally will touch 86. In Barak valley we will get seven seats,” he said. There are 15 seats in Southern Assam’s Barak valley. In 2016, BJP had won eight seats, while All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) won four and Congress three seats.

Assam had a three-phase assembly poll and counting of ballots will take place on May 2. Congress cobbled up 10 parties led -Grand alliance (Mahajhot) to take on the BJP led alliance.

That was said by Maruti as well as Bajaj Auto NSE 0.22 %. It is going to remain a concern for some time to come despite what they may have delivered in quarterly numbers. How do you read into this commentary?\\nIf the commodity prices keep surging and staying there, then it is much easier to pass on because typically commodity prices account for 20-25% in an automobile. In a Rs 5-lakh Maruti car, if Rs 1 lakh is commodity price and even if it is subsidised by 20%, still 5-6% will be added to the sales price. Once it can be passed on, some margin sacrifice will be there but I do not see a 20% increase in the sales price.\\n\\nThe auto sector has gone through some crazy times in transitioning from BS IV to BS VI and on top of it, the 28% GST and now there is a slowdown. It is a very important manufacturing base. This year will not be a great year for autos broadly.\\n\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Tata Steel Ltd moved up by 1 in 6 months on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\nWhat about metals which have been wealth creators for investors? Yesterday, there was news that China will be removing that rebate of 13% VAT on steel exports from May 1. We have seen phenomenal gains across the board. Is it time for the commodity linked space to shine?\\nRight now they are shining like never before. So, I think there is a shortage of all kinds.\\n\\nNMDC, Tata Steel NSE 0.66 % are all rather active in today’s trading session.\\nThe capacity addition did not happen and the bumper demand for all kinds of durables had come back simultaneously. The low interest rates environment is also giving a chance. There is massive speculation in the commodities and demand is strong. It is all across. Plastics, steel, copper whatever is traded, is on fire. It is to do with the lot of liquidity sloshing around and demand being very strong after the Covid subsided in many parts of the world.\\n\\nOn the back of that, we have been talking about the cyclical theme versus defensives and the return possibility on cyclicals at a time like this. How would you be going about it?\\nIt is very challenging to manage large money which is shifting from one side to another. But we do whatever we can do with our understanding of things but one cannot sit not taking notice of the opportunities here.\\n\\nInfra is a pocket that you are still confident on given the fact that we are seeing a spending push on that front. Steel aside, will cement, infra and even real estate to some extent will continue to thrive?\\nSitting here, it looks like things are grim on the ground level, but other markets like China and the US are dollar priced. All the commodities are dollar priced and if there is a boom in China and in the US, obviously it will boom here also. That is happening and the difficult part is to fathom what it is. Is it a super cycle? Is it a temporary blip? It has gone up vertically and it can fall vertically. So, there are danger in commodities if there is a demand collapse in any part of the world. Right now. it is taken for granted that demand will surge. Till global monetary systems start tightening, we have at least one year upmove. The current trend is likely to strengthen and there is an opportunity.\\n\\nHow are you looking at capitalising on the new tech as well as strong digitisation play across the spectrum? Will it be via unlisted players? Are you looking at traditional IT plays or fintech players?\\nDigitisation is here to stay and is going to become a more important part of life. Twenty years ago, there was hardly any internet and today without internet, we cannot do anything. This is how the technology keeps becoming more and more important. Earlier tech used to be only a support function. Today if you do not have tech, howsoever good you are in your profession, I do not think you are going to make it.\\n\\nOne has to look for businesses suited for online kind of fulfilment. The capacity of financial system can be literally unlimited. If you are selling some physical goods, your capacity is limited to whatever is available. If you are selling cement, even by online you can only sell as much as you can produce. But in the case of financial services, the capacity is literally unlimited. As the volume goes up, the cost per unit goes down. The possibilities of digital economy is quite staggering and we have just about started.\\n\\nAs the digital companies in India gets listed, we are definitely going to see many companies coming in which are pure digital, 50% digital or 70% digital. The biggest thing is that people like us, who are not children of digital economy, have to improve our understanding of this particular way of thinking because digital economy, digital companies are not built for EPS and PE. They have a very different way of building businesses. Eventually they make money, there is a lot of free cash flow and that is what you value. But to start with, it could be very different and by the time you realise it is a good business, valuations get crazy. It will be difficult but we will try to learn the game and let us see whether we can really come on top of it.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRaamdeo AgrawalCyclical ThemeCommoditiesEt NowStock MarketTata SteelBajaj AutoNMDCMotilal Oswal Financial Services\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

The polls started on March 27 and concluded on April 29.\\n\\nSingh has claimed that there is an \"indirect discrimination\" against the general public as fines are collected from them for violating COVID-19 norms, but no action is taken against politicians.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCovidElection CommissionDelhi High CourtMHAPandemicMinistry Of Home AffairsSecond Wave\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nM.L.GUPTA\\n119 days ago\\nThe Home Ministry and the M/o H&FW etc. should take action against producers/sellers of \"CORONA DAVAI\".

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place.\\nGetty Images\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\nRELATED\\nFinancial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India\\n3 approaches to equity investing\\nAuto, insurance good for investment in medium to long term: Kunj Bansal\\nBy Erin Lowry\\n\\nLook around and you’d see a digital-era gold rush. There’s hype about cryptocurrencies, NFTs and GameStop-gate, not to mention the continued rise of the stock market, which many are watching through their Robinhood apps. Although some people will amass wealth through these assets, there is another form of investing that’s piqued my interest as of late.\\n\\nIn researching different ways to build wealth, I was struck by the opportunities VC and angel investors have for not only generating returns but also shaping the future.\\n\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place. They can fund ventures with innovative ideas that other investors might not see and back companies created by underrepresented founders in the startup world.\\n\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\n\\nOne issue, however, is access. As is often the case in wealth building, it takes money to make money. Angel investors are generally required to be “accredited investors.” For decades, the threshold for being accredited in the U.S. meant you needed either a net worth of $1 million, excluding a primary residence, or an individual income of at least $200,000 in each of the two most recent years ($300,000 for those filing jointly). In December 2020, the SEC expanded the definition to allow “natural persons to qualify as accredited investors based on certain professional certifications, designations or credentials or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution, which the Commission may designate from time to time by order.”\\n\\nHowever, there is a discussion about whether the net worth and income requirements are too low for today’s climate. One angel told me she felt these were too low for those in expensive cities because one would need to invest more to be adequately diversified. She’d prefer to see $5 million as the net worth minimum.\\n\\nHere’s the rationale. A 2017 survey found the median investment by an American angel was $25,000 per round to a single company. Now, let’s say you need to invest in at least 10 companies to be a diversified angel investor. That’d be a quarter-of-a-million dollars, which could mean 25% of someone’s net worth. Considering the volatility of the investments, even when properly diversified, that’s entirely too much risk. The prevailing rule of thumb is to not have more than 5% of your portfolio in speculative investments.\\n\\nBut although it makes sense to ensure investors are property diversified, this cap is incredibly restrictive. Demanding a $5 million or even $1 million net worth effectively blocks people from what can be impactful wealth building opportunities.\\n\\nFortunately, things are changing. Much like fractional shares changed the ability to invest in stocks, technology is opening up more opportunities for individuals to take advantage of angel investing. Enter equity crowdfunding.\\n\\nPlenty of millennials are familiar with crowdfunding via platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, where people ask for money to start a business or help with unexpected expenses, and funders donate without expecting any ownership in the project or repayment. Equity crowdfunding operates along a similar principle in that you pool your money with anonymous strangers on the Internet, but in this case it’s to fund a company.\\n\\nThe big difference is, you get an interest in the business. It’s akin to contributing to an index fund or fractional shares. You own a small slice of equity, depending on how much you invest.\\n\\nEquity crowdfunding comes in two common forms: accredited, which is defined the same way as above, and open-access regulated, which is open to anyone who can legally invest. Sites like Republic and WeFunder offer the regular, non-accredited investor (like me) a chance to give angel investing a try. The type of security can vary based on the startup. For example, Republic offers Crowd SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), Token Purchase Agreements for Blockchain-related projects and Crowd Simple Debt Agreements.\\n\\nWhen considering how much to invest, it’s critical to remember that this should only be a speculative part of anyone’s portfolio. Settle on an amount of money you’re comfortable losing to the cause of funding a company you believe should exist and to — let’s be honest — the hope of making some money as well.\\n\\nDon’t forget that you’re just as likely to lose significant money or see your stake diluted overtime. Stats on startup failures run the gamut, but an oft-quoted one is that 90% fail in the first three years. Even if you were to be optimistic and say 50% — that’s still good odds you’d lose your money.\\n\\nI think attempts to democratize angel investing through equity crowdfunding are worthwhile because they point to a world where it’s not only the wealthy determining which startups live or die based on who gets funding. This doesn’t mean early-stage investing is the right route for everyone or that it will yield more than dashed dreams of funding the next Google or Facebook or Uber. But it’s a compelling option if you want to put (a small percentage of) your money to work.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAngel InvestingSecAngel InvestorsStock MarketGoogleCommissionGofundmeRobinhood\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Having a manager whose leadership style puts a strain on their daily life can be a challenge – especially in uncertain times such as this. Many of us have come across various types of dysfunctional bosses- the passive aggressive one who makes those unnecessary sarcastic comments and remarks in meetings of your work, the micro-manager who wants to haunt you at every step of the project and changes/corrects every step. The abusive/aggressive one, who screams loudly to express their thoughts about everything you do. Or the stalker manager who checks on your every move at work – even when you take that much needed coffee break. Here’s how you can deal with a demanding boss, and keep your job.\\n\\n- Calm your body to calm yourself. Your body is always a good place to start to acknowledge and build awareness of defences that might be up. Focus on your body and what’s happening within. It might be helpful to take 5 mindful breathes to be able to focus on what is inside and what is outside. Neuroscience tells us that embodied practice is where real and sustainable behavioural change occurs.\\n\\n- Make sure you have identified the difference between being a boss and being bossy. This means exercising authority is not the same as being overly authoritative. Someone needs to be the one in-charge, the one to make decisions, and to make sure work is done in a timely fashion. A good boss will see when their team needs direction and will provide it in a constructive way. A bossy boss will try to control the situation by demanding certain things to be done without taking into consideration the capacity of the employee.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\n- When struggling with unrealistic deadlines or expectations it is essential to bring your expertise, gauge the scenario and not dwell into insecurity that you can’t do it. And yet if it still feels unrealistic, review it regarding how much time and effort it would actually take from your experience and then find ways to communicate that. Try chunking a big project into small tasks so as to not get overwhelmed by the deadlines placed on you.\\n\\n- Evaluate your boss’s approach and style to understand if you’ll get a better response by behaving proactively or reactively. The way boss’s work could also be a management culture. Embodying the boss’s style helps to know what to expect and how to respond to it. You'll gain valuable insights into some of the ways you may be holding yourself back from being able to make greater contributions.\\n\\n-Build empathy. It would be very difficult to be empathetic in situations that feel like a dead-end. Try to understand what is leading your boss to be this way. It will definitely help you to see and understand things from their perspective. What is the boss’s outlook? What might he/she be dealing with in their role? What challenges do they have to face?\\n\\n- Feasible and realistic solutions tend to catch more attention and acknowledgements. Be receptive to the feedback that you receive but do not accept all the feedback. If you disagree, you can communicate authentically without being aggressive or disrespectful. Approach your boss in a calm, professional, and rational manner. Asking for feedback doesn’t necessarily mean it will be positive. So be open to the idea of critical feedback. Your success also depends on the delivery and timing of your discussion; make sure you listen and are mindful of how you respond.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDemanding BossCalmBossNeuroscienceMental HealthWork StressWork From Home\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",

Those below 18 years would be most vulnerable,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After each wave flattens, we have seen a resurgence in other countries too. It’ll take 90-120 days after the wave flattens for the virus resurgence,” said Dr CN Manjunath, head, Covid-19 expert committee and nodal officer for Covid testing in the state.\\n\\nCovid live updates\\n\\nKarnataka’s experience, and that of European countries, shows that the third wave will be definitely there and preparation to tackle it must be taken seriously, say experts. Covid-appropriate behaviour like mask usage, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowds and hand hygiene, apart from vaccination, must be given utmost priority, they say.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Dr Manjunath, all precautionary measures, restrictions on gatherings, religious events, political rallies, local body elections and fairs must be continued till December 2021. “The severity will be more in unvaccinated persons. The need is to speed up vaccination,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe agreed with Dr Sudarshan that children would be more vulnerable. “There are trials of Pfizer vaccines on children. By then, we may get vaccines for children too,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to Dr KR Bharath Kumar Reddy, paediatric pulmonologist and director, Shishuka Children’s Specialty Hospital, children would be vulnerable because of lack of vaccination. “However, the virus transmission chain may break as adults at home would be vaccinated and they may not spread to kids. Currently, in most cases, adults are transmitting to children who are not going to schools,” Dr Reddy said.\\n\\nUnless those in the 18-44 years category are vaccinated by October, a high number of cases will be seen among them too, experts said.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nResurgenceCovidChildrenKarnatakaTechnical Advisory CommitteeTACThird WaveVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n6 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nvaradharajan balasubramanian\\n119 days ago\\nyoung people should know this virus can adopt itself to changing situations.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations.\\nGetty Images\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years.\\nRELATED\\nPhysical gold in India swings to discount as pandemic stalls demand\\nView: Inflation-tolerant Fed will boost commodity prices\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nCOMMODITY SUMMARY\\nMCX\\nCOPPER\\nBy Eddie Spence and Megan Durisin\\n\\nThe prices of raw materials used to make almost everything are skyrocketing, and the upward trajectory looks set to continue as the world economy roars back to life.\\n\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years. The rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations. With the U.S. economy pumped up on fiscal stimulus, and Europe’s economy starting to reopen as its vaccination rollout gets into gear, there’s little reason to expect a change in direction.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. said this week it sees a continued rally in commodities and that the “reflation and reopening trade will continue.” On top of that, the Federal Reserve and other central banks seem calm about inflation, meaning economies could be left to run hot, which will rev up demand even more.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\n“The most important drivers supporting commodity prices are the global economic recovery and acceleration in the reopening phase,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. The bank expects commodities as a whole to rise about 10% in the next year.\\n\\nChina, a crucial source of supply and demand for raw materials, is playing a big role, particularly as the government tries to reduce production of key metals like steel and aluminum. It’s also buying up massive amounts of grains. Food prices are also being affected as poor weather in key growing nations like Brazil and France hits harvests.\\n\\nAs just about every basic material gets rapidly more expensive, here’s some ways the rally is rippling across the globe to create winners and losers.\\n\\nGoing Green\\nCopper has enjoyed an unstoppable rally for more than a year thanks to pledges by governments to boost renewable energy and electric vehicle use. That’ll make all the various forms of green technology that rely on it a bit more expensive.\\n\\nBigger power grids is one such case. About 1.9 million tons of copper was used to build electricity networks in 2020, according to BloombergNEF, and the price of the red metal is up more than 90% in the past year. Usage will almost double by 2050, BNEF forecasts, while demand from other low carbon technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels will also balloon.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBuyers and Sellers\\nFor countries, the impact of the commodity rally depends on whether they’re an exporter or importer. For those relying heavily on exporting raw materials, the huge upswings can only be good news for public finances, especially when they’ve just been stricken by a once-in-a-century pandemic. The likes of Australia (iron ore), Chile (copper) and Indonesia (palm oil) all make huge sums from commodities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, countries looking to rebuild infrastructure may find their budgets buy less than they used to. President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion plan is one such case. Electricity grids, railways and refurbishing buildings are among the items on the shopping list that will use large amounts of metal.\\n\\nConsultancy CRU Group estimates the program will add 5 million tons of steel to the 80 million the U.S. uses each year, with similar boosts to aluminum and copper demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nMeat\\nIt’s been a tough year to be in the meat business, from devastating Covid outbreaks to the deadly pig disease that hit Germany and is roaring back in China.\\n\\nAnd as crop prices surge, farmers rearing poultry, pigs and cattle are among the first to get squeezed by the eye-watering run-up in grains. Costs for corn fed to livestock have doubled in the past year, and soybean meal is more than 40% higher. While there’s a delay before that hits the burger chain or steakhouse, there are already signs of prices creeping higher.\\n\\nOld Steel Mills\\nSteel producers in Europe and America have suffered for years from low prices caused by global overcapacity. Plants struggled to make money and job security became a growing worry. Over 85,000 steel jobs were lost in the European Union between 2008 and 2019, according to industry association Eurofer.\\n\\nThat’s all changed dramatically thanks to booming steel prices. Futures in China, by far the biggest producer, have smashed records — even outpacing gains in key ingredient iron ore — as the government took measures to curb output. That’s supercharged rallies of benchmark prices in Europe and America, where mills were already running at maximum capacity as they try to meet unexpectedly high demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBreakfast Tables\\nWhether you prefer latte or espresso, sweetened or plain, the key ingredients of a cup of coffee have surged. Arabica coffee futures have risen about 33% in the past year, while raw sugar has also advanced. Fancy a slice of toast? Benchmark wheat prices have hit the highest since 2013.\\n\\nOf course, rising commodities don’t immediately show up on grocery shelves and cafe menus. They make up just a part of the costs for retailers, which often absorb the initial increase to keep customers coming back. But there’s a limit to that margin hit, and high prices could ultimately feed through to consumers.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSteelLumberCornUBS Group AGEuropean UnionCopperCommoditiesFederal Reserve\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Shares of the video game retailer and many other meme stocks that rallied in its wake are well off their highs, and retail trading has dropped from levels seen earlier in the year.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing some return of interest to those Reddit-type stocks but not with the same pace and fervor we saw before,\" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management.\\n\\nStill, some market-watchers believe a smaller-scale face-off between retail investors and short sellers may have sparked part of the volatility in MicroVision and other recent movers.\\n\\nAverage short interest in a basket of 50 stocks with market capitalization of under $100 billion monitored by Vanda Research has climbed to levels last seen in January, the firm said in a report earlier this week.\\n\\nAt the same time, cash equity purchases and the premium spent on call options for MicroVision and some of the other gainers soared in recent weeks, an indicator of retail buying, according to analysts at Vanda, which tracks retail activity.\\n\\n\"With the precedent of Melvin Capital in mind, we suspect that the long/short community started to trim bearish bets as soon as they sniffed a potential comeback from the Reddit crowd,\" Vanda’s analysts wrote.\\n\\nMicroVision, which traded below $1 as recently as June 2020, is up 210% since short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the company’s stock on Dec. 22, illustrating the potential dangers bearish investors face when positioning against meme stocks. Hindenburg Research did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\n“Right now you can have a perfectly logical reason to short a stock and still take a terrible beating if a group of small traders pull together to push the stock in the other direction,\" said Phipps.\\n\\nWATCHING WSB\\nCarson Block, founder of short seller Muddy Waters Research, said he keeps a keen eye on online chatter and forums such as WallStreetBets, where users often attempt to coordinate their buying in stocks they believe are short-squeeze candidates.\\n\\n“We are now watching closely,” said Block.\\n\\nBlock said he is now more focused on technical aspects such as companies where a high percentage of stock is owned by insiders and institutional investors that are unlikely to sell the shares.\\n\\nWhether the stars will align anytime soon for another move on the scale of GameStop\\'s remains to be seen. That stock had a combination of short interest that peaked at about 145% of the float, according to S3 Partners data, a massive following among retail investors and institutions happy to jump in on the shares\\' wild ride.\\n\\nInvestors are “looking for history possibly to repeat or looking for stocks that are going to go parabolic,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. However, “GameStop was such an outlier in price moves that (it) is difficult for that to happen again.”\\n\\nThere are signs, however, that broader trading activity among retail investors may be picking up.\\n\\nIn the latest week, there was $700 million in net retail buying of large-cap companies tracked by JPMorgan, compared with $500 million in the previous period, the bank said in a report issued on Wednesday.\\n\\nVanda Research said purchases of single stocks by retail investors have ticked higher, though they remain much lower than in previous months. Meanwhile, buying of exchange-traded funds by retail investors fell earlier in the week to its lowest levels since late last year, a potential sign they may be ready to take on more risk, the firm said.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nMeme StocksS3 PartnersJPMorganWallstreet BetsVideo Game Retailer Gamestop CorpPhippsMelvin CapitalGameStop CorpStocks\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Household size was an important explanatory factor for the disparity for COVID-19 mortality in South Asian groups only.\\n\\nDr Mathur said: \"While multigenerational living may increase risk of exposure and transmission (from children or working age adults to older or vulnerable family members), such households and extended communities also offer valuable informal care networks and facilitate engagement with health and community services.\\n\\n\"In light of emerging evidence that minority ethnic groups are less likely to take up the COVID-19 vaccine, co-designing culturally competent and non-stigmatising engagement strategies with these communities is increasingly important.\"\\n\\nOn behalf of NHS England, the research team used the new secure OpenSAFELY data analytics platform to analyse partially anonymised electronic health data collected by general practitioners (GPs) covering 40 per cent of England.\\n\\nThese GP records were linked to other national coronavirus-related data sets for the first and second waves of the pandemic - including testing, hospital data and mortality records. Ethnicity was self-reported by participants in GP records and grouped into five census categories (white, South Asian, Black, other, mixed) and then a further 16 sub-groups.\\n\\n\"Minority ethnic groups in the UK are disproportionately affected by factors that also increase the risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, such as living in deprived areas, working in front-line jobs, and having poorer access to healthcare,\" notes Dr Mathur.\\n\\n\"Our study indicates that even after accounting for many of these factors, the risk for testing positive, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death was still higher in minority ethnic groups compared with white people in England.\\n\\n\"To improve COVID-19 outcomes, we urgently need to tackle the wider disadvantage and structural racism faced by these communities, as well as improving access to care and reducing transmission,\" she said.\\n\\nThe authors caution that there are some limitations to the study including an inability to capture all potential explanatory variables, including occupation, health-related behaviours, and experiences of racism or structural discrimination.\\n\\nThey call for improving the completeness of ethnicity recording in health data to further support the conduct of high-quality research into addressing health inequalities for COVID-19 and beyond.\\n\\nThe study, believed to be the largest of its type, was funded by the UK\\'s Medical Research Council and conducted by scientists from a group of universities including LSHTM and the University of Oxford, along with the National Institute of Health Research.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nTesting PositiveCovidNHS EnglandLondon School Of Hygiene & Tropical MedicineCoronavirusMinority Ethnic GroupsLancetUniversity Of Oxford\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nBank of Baroda, RBL and IDFC First could double from here: Sanjiv Bhasin\\nGame not over in pharma, chemicals: Pashupati Advani\\nIf you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now, says Naveen Kulkarni, CIO, Axis Securities Ltd.\\n\\n2020 was all about Reliance and those big deals that we saw for Jio and retail. What will be the next picture for RIL NSE -0.14 %? That’s what the markets would want to know.\\nIf you look at Reliance Industries, the stock did pretty well till October or so. November onwards, the stock started cooling off and from highs closer to Rs 2,300, the stock has been hovering between Rs 1,800-2,200. The stock has corrected and there has been some bit of derating also that has happened.\\n\\nBut having said that, the critical aspect is how the overall industry cycle is going to pan out. If the O2C segment starts doing better, then I think there is a play because the stock has been an underperformer for the last four to five months. The important aspect that we need to see is how sustainable these trends are going to be. The current quarter numbers look quite encouraging. If the trend continues to be an upcycle, there is much scope for the stock to do well just based on the operating performance.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Reliance Industries Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAs far as other triggers are concerned, the Aramco deal is pretty much one aspect that we could be looking at. Apart from that, if the retail business or digital services business gets listed on foreign bourses, those could be the trigger. It could be the long-term trigger but from an operating performance perspective, the O2C segment is going to be very critical. We already know how the Jio platform business is panning out. The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place. Other businesses are where they see more value to be created, especially the O2C segment.\\n\\nWould it make sense for Reliance shareholders to hold a stake in Aramco and give up stake in O2C? Will the deal be as attractive as a plain cash for stake deal?\\nIt is difficult to make a case for that at this point in time. It remains to be seen how a pure share swap deal will enthuse the investors. Cash has also its own advantages as well as disadvantages. But we will have to wait and watch out what exactly is on offer. Also, an important factor will be what it could mean in terms of controlling stake and how the company is going to be run. Those will be the critical aspects that one will have to watch out for. It is difficult to gauge the benefits at this point in time. But it might be a very interesting thing to look at. We have not had something like this in India as far as I can remember. So that will be something that we all will be looking forward to.\\n\\nWould we see Reliance Industries’ three main businesses being hived off into three different divisions? Is that something all of you in the markets and the analysts community are still following up?\\nMore important aspect will be how the holding structure will pan out once the business is structured. There are a lot of moving parts here. One is to look at that sum of the parts and say that the value of the sum of the parts is probably higher than what the market is ascribing to in terms of numbers. But the important aspect would be how the structuring will actually happen and more importantly, how the businesses will be run after that.\\n\\nIt is like two to three steps ahead of what we are able to analyse at this point in time in terms of the sum of parts valuation. So it remains to be seen. If you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now. But the challenge has been that it is difficult to envisage how the structure of the company will evolve post that and that is why the market is ascribing the value to what the sum of the parts valuation entails. So we will have to wait and watch out how that happens, but as far as the analyst community is concerned, the sum of the parts valuation for these three businesses are very much considered and that is the way that company is being valued now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSegment PicksJioReliance IndustriesAramcoRilNaveen KulkarniRill O2C Business\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

As many as 15,523 people have died since the outbreak of the pandemic last year.\\n\\nCiting Maharashtra where a 44-day lockdown brought the infection under control to a good extent, Sudhakar appealed to the people to follow the regulations instead of loitering around unnecessarily.\\n\\nTo a question on the vaccination drive for people above 18 years of age, which could not take off fully from May 1 as was announced by the Central government, he said adequate stock of vaccine did not arrive due to which the drive was started symbolically by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa with the available stock of three lakh vaccines.\\n\\n\"We have a stock of vaccines, which is not huge to meet the requirement. We will inform people once the vaccines arrive in the State,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Health Minister said the State government has set a target to vaccinate everyone.\\n\\nTo a question on shortage of drugs and oxygen, he said there is unnecessary panic among people who are hoarding Remdesivir vials and oxygen fearing that they would not get in case of an emergency. According to him, at least 85 per cent of the infected people remain asymptomatic whereas only five to eight per cent show moderate symptoms.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDr K SudhakarKarnatakaLockdownHealth Minister\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " \"Synopsis\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports.\\nGetty Images\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level.\\nRELATED\\nSelloff shows market to remain shackled by Covid fears for now\\nDIIs emerge smart buyers as bulls & bears play tug of war\\nForeign investors bet on economy rebound as they look beyond India's Covid-19 crisis\\nNifty’s trading range remained wider than usual during the week gone by, but it took a serious cut on Friday’s session. Despite that, the index managed to close the week on a positive note. In the previous weekly note, we had mentioned that Nifty was trading inside the Falling Channel that it had created, and any decisive move above the 15,000 mark would offer cues about the market’s upward move.\\n\\nHowever, the index has failed to move past that point and stayed inside the channel. Following a rangebound week, the headline index finally ended with a net gain of 289 points (+2.02%) on a weekly basis.\\n\\nIn the week before this one, Nifty had violated an important pattern support that comes in the form of a Rising Trend Line drawn from the lows of March 2020. Despite the violation of this pattern support, Nifty averted weakness this time by managing to hang around precariously near this trend line.\\n\\nVolatility has risen and INDIA VIX has grown marginally by 1.49% to 23.0300 level. For the coming week and beyond, it would be crucially important for the 50-pack to stay above this trend line, and any failure to do so will increase the possibility of violation of the Falling Channel that the Nifty is in. This can also invite incremental weakness in the market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports. In the event of any corrective move, this trading range is likely to widen. The weekly RSI stands at 58.86; it stays neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD remains bearish and stays below the Signal Line.\\n\\nA Shooting Star formation has emerged on the candles. Such a formation would occur when the price shows a gapup start, trends higher, but closes much lower being unable to sustain the gains.\\n\\nSince such a candle has emerged near a pattern resistance level, it can have bearish implications. However, as always, this would require confirmation on the next bar. Pattern analysis showed Nifty is inside a channel that it has formed; and it has not been able to break out of this channel and is clinging on to an important pattern support of a trend line that begins from March 2020 lows and joins the subsequent higher bottoms.\\n\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level. While the market is in seeing such a retracement, the out-of-control Covid situation in the country is hitting investor sentiment hard. There is a clear shift in preference towards the traditionally defensive stocks.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nWe recommend staying highly stock-specific and keeping fresh purchases limited to low-beta and defensive stocks. All rallies should be used more for taking some money off the table rather than making fresh purchases. While keeping the overall exposures at a modest level, a highly cautious outlook is advised for the coming week.\\n\\nIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectoral indices against CNX500 (Nifty500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free-float market-cap of all the listed stocks.\\n\\nTJE review of RRG showed only Metal, Midcap100 and the Commodity Indices are showing steady relative momentum while being placed inside the leading quadrant. Energy, Infrastructure and PSE Indices are inside the leading quadrant, but they all appear to be losing their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty PSU Bank, Realty and Nifty Bank Indices are all inside the weakening quadrant. All of them appear to be rotating south-west and giving up their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to relatively underperform the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Financial Services index has rolled inside the lagging quadrant, while the Auto Index is languishing inside this quadrant. Nifty IT and Media indices are also inside this quadrant, but they were seen improving their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Consumption Index has just rolled inside the improving quadrant. It joins Nifty Pharma and FMCG indices, which are also inside the improving quadrant. They appear to be steadily maintaining their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to show a resilient performance and relatively outperform the broader market.\\n\\nImportant Note: RRGTM charts show the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. In the above chart, they show relative performance against the Nifty500 Index (broader market) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.\\n\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA is a Consultant Technical Analyst and founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, Vadodara.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\nAgencies\\nRepresentative Image\\nIndia is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic. On April 25, 2021, we reported over 3.5 lakh cases of fresh infections from the coronavirus. This was the highest ever single day account since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from the steep surge in the rate of infections, another pressing concern is the rising fatality rate. Onwards April 19, 2021, we have been losing over 2000 lives daily to the virus.\\n\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\n\\nIndia’s Vaccination Plan\\nThe first phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, 2021. It aimed to inoculate 30 crores of people by July 2021 with a target of 70 lakh doses administered daily. In line with WHO’s recommendations, the beneficiaries of the first phase were healthcare and frontline workers. Subsequently, the second phase of the inoculation drive saw the net being widened. People over the age of 60, or people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, were eligible beneficiaries. On April 1, 2021, the second phase was extended to people of 45 years and above. The third phase of the vaccination would be set in motion from May 1, 2021. It will provide access to vaccines for people in the age group of 18-45 years of age.\\n\\nThe National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration opted for the distribution of the vaccines as per age groups. This made sense as the fatalities recorded in people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities were significantly higher. However, the slow rate of vaccination at 8.7 % of the total population in 90 days compared to 36.3 % in the US and 32.3 % in the UK is proving to be counter-intuitive of this theory. The sluggishness is partly due to the initial vaccine hesitancy followed soon after by huge vaccine shortage. May be this was one reason for PM Modi to exhort the nation into celebration of 'Tika Utsav' vaccination festival from April 11 to April 14. However, the doses administered during the Tika Utsav fell due to supply constraints.\\n\\nVaccine shortage\\nBetween April 1 and April 2021, on an average 36 lakh doses were administered across the country. But, during the Tika Utsav, on an average only 32 lakh doses were administered. As many as 900 inoculation centres (65 %) were closed all over Odisha because of unavailability of vaccines. Odisha was only provided one-tenth of its demand for 25 lakh vaccines for 10 days for the Tika Utsav, despite the state achieving negative vaccine wastage. Average vaccinations have shrunk from 32 lakhs during the Tika Utsav to just about 25 lakhs between April 15 and April 26. Whereas a record low of 9 lakh vaccinations took place on April 25, the day the country recorded its highest ever daily cases of fresh infections.\\n\\nThis problem is likely to get accentuated in phase 3 of the vaccination process due to acute shortage in manufacture and supply of vaccines. Odisha, for example, does not expect its vaccination to start before May 15 for Covaxin and end of May for Covishield.\\n\\nUnlike other countries which boldly stockpiled corona virus vaccines even when they were undergoing clinical trials, India probably played inexplicably safe. We continued to put ad hoc orders and did not strengthen the production line of Bharat Biotech (BB) (producer of Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (SII) (producer of Covishield) until recently. Maybe we assumed that there would not be a second wave.\\n\\nBurden on the States\\nAdded to the above, the higher price of both the vaccines for states has put them under enormous fiscal burden. In the third phase, beginning May 1, cumulatively about 60 crores of population (aged between 18-45 years) would be eligible for vaccination in various states whereas the national age-wise distribution of population over the age of 45 accounts for only about 34 crores. This implies that there is a disproportionate fiscal pressure on the states most of whom have understandably already declared universal free vaccinations. This is further aggravated manifold by a higher pricing (Rs.400-Rs.600) of both the vaccine types for the states compared to the Centre (Rs.150 per dose) even while all earlier universal immunization efforts in India have been Central schemes with a pre-determined sharing pattern between Centre and states to keep the implementation simple.\\n\\nThe states could have harnessed this money towards strengthening the already noticeable inadequate infrastructure in the district and sub-district hospitals, preparing for a possible third wave. Additionally, the higher price of Covaxin and Covishield for private hospitals would crowd out the private sector and their infrastructure and manpower from this national effort as people would throng government centres for free shots, thus putting enormous pressure on the existing fragile government–run vaccination centres.\\n\\nWay Forward\\nVaccinate and vaccinate fast. This is the best-fit solution. Along with Covid appropriate behaviour, an expedited vaccination drive is the need of the hour to break the chain of transmission. Currently, we have only vaccinated about 10 persons per capita while Brazil and China have vaccinated 18 and 16 persons per capita. At present, the centre should enforce immediate compulsory licensing under Patent Act for both the manufacturers while simultaneously approving a greater number of manufactures and vaccine types to preclude possibilities of cartelisation and profiteering. This would allow other manufacturers without infringing on intellectual property. Additionally, India should continue to advocate for relaxation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) given the global health emergency to quickly ramp up production of vaccines.\\n\\n(The author is Member of Rajya Sabha of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) from Odisha.

       " \"Synopsis\\n‘The year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses’\\nETMarkets.com\\nGoing forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nRIL stock may rally if O2C segment picks up: Naveen Kulkarni\\nPharma, chemicals, speciality chemicals game not over; look at infra too: Pashupati Advani\\nThe margin trends of consumer companies will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities.\\n\\nWhat is the stance that you will be taking on banks going forward? Is it the lending services where one needs to have a larger exposure or should one focus on corporate-facing banks or retail-oriented ones? Where should one actually hold positions?\\nThe results of most of the banks were slightly disappointing to begin with. I was quite surprised when most of these banks started going up this week. They had indeed moderated over the last one day but overall, the week has been good for the banks. The results were quite bad for most of the banks because if you look at the NPA trend and really focus on the quality of the earnings that have been reported, the proforma invoices are pretty large for most of the banks. You can clearly make out the distinction between two sets of banks; banks that have made good amounts of provisions versus banks that have not made good amounts of provisions. They are also struggling with their capitalisation ratio, i.e., the tier one capitalisation.\\n\\nIf you distinguish these parameters, you will notice that the year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses to be borne with as we go forward.\\n\\nAs it is, we have now this vicious second wave of Covid coming in and that is going to create a whole lot of problems for the banking sector. Going forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors and if you ask me frankly, the markets are going to get a little jittery as we close out the May month.\\n\\nHow are you looking at some of the consumption companies that have come out with their earnings? Given the kind of commentary they have given in terms of the volume growth and given the current environment, what is it that you are expecting in terms of trends from consumers?\\nConsumer companies have reported good earnings and most of them actually have reported margins against the fear that commodity costs were going up. The margin trends have been quite good. Volume growth, of course, has been in double digits and that is what was expected from most of the consumer companies. We also know that the logistics are unaffected due to government’s lockdown measures.\\n\\nGiven this situation, for most of the consumer companies who are dependent on logistics companies, there is a lot of e-commerce kind of distribution happening. There are also a lot of digitisation moves that we are seeing. We will encourage most of the FMCG companies to maintain their growth trends ahead.\\n\\nHowever, I still believe that the margin trends will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost push that we had seen come into their earnings in the first quarter. So again, going forward it will be a little bit negative for FMCG companies. The margin trends will be weaker. But the only good point that we should acknowledge here is most of them should be looking at better volume growth as we move ahead.\\n\\nWhat is your outlook on the entire infrastructure/capital goods space? What is it that you are factoring in by way of the execution of the ordering trends in light of the second wave?\\nMost of the infrastructure project activities are subdued as you have labour shortages. You even have material shortages coming in certain places and order intake has been quite weak. Most of the orders that you are seeing are driven by government orders, which are pending for several months and therefore being expedited now. There is no fresh capex intent that we are seeing in a big manner and therefore, the overall capital goods and infrastructure space is going to be a little weaker.\\n\\nAlso, remember that the inflation is perking up a little bit and we sense that somewhere, the RBI will have to step in either with the rate increase or an outlook that tries to tighten the overall money supply situation so that inflation is in a way reined in. Any rise in inflation and thereby rise in interest rates does not augur really well for most of the infrastructure companies or most of the capital goods companies. So the outlook remains quite weak for the capital goods companies.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCapital Goods StocksMargin TrendsRBIFmcgInfrastructure StocksGood EarningsConsumer CompaniesNPAMahantesh Sabarad\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

       " 'Synopsis\\nThis time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up.\\niStock\\nSkinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over.\\nRELATED\\nHow e-commerce has changed shopping rules in the pandemic\\nThese robots are helping residents of Singapore with grocery shopping\\nCovid19 second wave-led local restrictions, curfews halve malls, shopping centres’ revenue\\nWomen are saying yes to the dress. The garment has become one emblem of the post-lockdown consumer, as economies slowly reopen in places like the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nAnd dressier clothing is just the start of what may be a “great rotation” in consumer spending. At the end of last year, we argued that a vaccine-driven economic recovery would shift what people buy — they’d order less leisure wear and buy fewer cushions, but put more money toward champagne, suits and experiences. In categories like fashion and cosmetics, this shift is indeed happening; however, other areas like dining, travel and big events have yet to really get going.\\n\\nUntil trips to offices and sunny climes pick up again, retailers and manufacturers will have to manage this sputtering recovery and deal with levels of demand that may be much more, or much less, than they expected.\\n\\nUrban Outfitters Inc. was the first to signal the return to dressing up. It said that at its Anthropologie brand in the last week of February, seven of its 10 best-selling online items were dresses. Over the previous year, one or two dresses at most would have made the top 10.\\n\\nWhen British retail reopened in June and December 2020, shoppers bought many of the same things they were ordering in lockdown — lots of leisurewear and lingerie. This time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up, as are handbags and mascara (yes to above-the-mask makeup). There’s far less interest in comfortable clothes made for lounging at home.\\n\\n“Fashion is back,” declared Associated British Foods Plc, the owner of budget chain Primark. Clothing is undergoing its own metamorphosis: Skinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over. This is boosting denim sales, and should inspire sales of new tops and shoes to go with them.\\n\\nPutting on the Glitz\\nA return to office life will also fuel more fashion spending. Winser London, which specializes in stylish workwear for women, is seeing demand for more fitted dresses increase as cities open up again. Menswear hasn’t picked up as much, but sales should revive as employers call workers back to headquarters.\\n\\nSmarten Up\\nWhile the rotation in clothing appears well underway, the picture is more complicated in other consumer sectors. In food, for example, restaurants are getting busier, but people are still cooking and ordering a lot at home.\\n\\nNestle SA says it’s seeing demand recover for products used in restaurants, especially in China; at the same time, its Nespresso coffee unit is still benefiting from remote workers being their own baristas. Rekki, a technology platform that connects independent restaurants with food suppliers, has also seen orders rise as the hospitality sector comes back.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\nStarbucks Corp. is starting to see recovery in sales at U.S. shops in dense, urban areas — the type that rely on office workers and tourists. But growth in its home market in the latest quarter was still powered by suburban locations and drive-thru windows, a sign that pandemic routines haven’t yet faded.\\n\\nEat Up\\nThe home improvement category hasn’t changed much yet, but spending on renovations and other projects is expected to slow over time. Now that you’ve built a new shed and extended that loft, you probably won’t be repeating the process anytime soon. Some makeover projects envisioned in lockdown are still underway or awaiting an available contractor, but there will likely be fewer starting as vacations and sports tickets reclaim wallet share.\\n\\nHolidays typically take a large chunk of the family budget. Right now, there’s a lot of uncertainty over international travel and fewer tourists are booking vacations abroad in sunny destinations such as Greece and Spain. (No wonder demand for swimwear is lagging fashion.) But if travel to and around Europe does resume this summer, it will unleash a torrent of spending. Unilever Plc says the performance of its European ice-cream business would be linked to whether people can visit beaches and tourist towns.\\n\\nBeing in the midst of these shifts means retailers and consumer goods groups must keep planning for uncertainty and remain flexible. Strategies will have to take into account the vastly different Covid experiences across regions. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, clothing and food retailers should be ready to increase their supply. In markets still ravaged by the virus, such as India, the emphasis will be on meeting the needs of people who need to isolate, stay at home and recover from the virus.\\n\\nAs the great post-pandemic shift in consumer habits inches along, the old adage that “retail is detail” has never been more appropriate.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNestle SAPandemic ShoppingNespressoUnilever PlcPandemic FashionStarbucks Corp.\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRamesh Shah\\n119 days ago\\nIN INDIA ITS OUT OF SHEER FRUSTRATIONS..\\nVIEW COMMENTS ADD COMMENTS',\n",

In some states like Uttar Pradesh, the lockdowns have been limited to weekends while in others like Delhi and Maharashtra, they have been extended for weeks.\\n\\nIndustry executives fear the government may be forced to impose larger lockdowns given the ferocity with which the virus is spreading and claiming lives across the country. “If there is a larger lockdown, fuel demand will take a heavy hit,” said an oil company executive. “Lower domestic demand would also result in lower refinery runs.”\\n\\nFollowing a sharp recovery in oil demand last year, Indian refiners had started operating at full capacity. The capacity utilisation has again started falling though some refiners are trying to place some of their volumes in the export market.\\n( Originally published on May 01, 2021 )\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nBharat Petroleum Corp.Hindustan PetroleumIndian Oil CorpHindustan Petroleum CorpCoronavirus InfectionsBharat Petroleum\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n2 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRashika Khandelwal\\n119 days ago\\nThe graph attached above showing fuel demand growth has incorrect legends.

Everyone entering the counting venue will have to undergo Thermal Screening, wear Face Masks and Face Shields.\\n\\nThis time, due to Covid-19 protocol, the number of counting tables in each counting hall has been restricted to 7 Tables. This is to maintain social distance inside the Counting Hall. There is an increase of 34.71% in the number of Polling Stations over the number of Polling Stations in the 2016 Assembly Elections.\\n\\nIt is partly due to provision of 5325 numbers of Auxiliary Polling Stations set up in the current elections. Hence, there will be more EVM machines to be counted this time. Accordingly, counting rounds will also increase this time, due to several factors including large number of postal ballots received, counting of VVPAT slips and restricted number of counting tables despite considerable increase in the number of counting halls. Due to these factors, counting of votes will take more time compared to earlier elections. The number of rounds will be varying from minimum around 10 rounds to around 33 rounds for each LAC, depending onthe number of Polling Stations and Counting Tables.\\n\\nEveryone entering the Counting Halls will have to maintain Covid protocol. To maintain Covid protocol, numbers of counting halls have been increased by 131% i.e. from 143 in 2016 Assembly Election to 331 this time.\\n\\nThere will be one Micro Observer at each counting table, who reports directly to the Counting Observer appointed by ECI for every LAC.

       " 'Synopsis\\nRahul Gandhi accused the government of misreading and mishandling the situation and alleged that all early warning signs were ignored, including from scientists.\\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi\\nIn a wide-ranging exclusive interview with PTI, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the entire world is shaken by the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India and there are queues everywhere, whether for oxygen cylinders, for life-saving medicines, for hospital beds and even outside crematoriums. He accused the government of misreading and mishandling the situation and alleged that all early warning signs were ignored, including from scientists. Here is the transcript of the interview:\\n\\nThe second wave of coronavirus has hit India hard. We see people gasping for medical aid, medicines, oxygen. They have no access to facilities in the national capital and across the country. How do you see the situation and the response of the government?\\nIt breaks my heart every single day to wake up to the absolute devastation around us. This is not a wave; it is a tsunami that has destroyed everything in its wake. There are never-ending queues everywhere. There are queues to get an oxygen cylinder, queues to refill the cylinder, queues to get life-saving medicines, queues to get a hospital bed, and now there are queues outside crematoriums. There is a fatal shortage of every single item we need to tackle COVID-19. Our capital\\'s best hospitals are bursting at the seams. We are getting frantic SOS calls for oxygen from India\\'s top doctors. Hospitals are petitioning High Courts for oxygen. Our healthcare workers are seeing patients die in front of their eyes, they cannot save people. India is now the world\\'s coronavirus epicentre. The entire world is shaken by what they are seeing in India. None of this should have happened. There were multiple early warning signs. Forget the signs, scientists clearly warned the government this would happen - they ignored them. We could and should have been much better prepared. And now, where is the government in this crisis? It is completely missing in action. They are obsessed only with saving the Prime Minister\\'s image and blaming others. The new buzzword is that the \\'system\\' has failed. Who is this \\'system\\'? Who runs the \\'system\\'? It\\'s just a ploy to avoid admitting responsibility.\\n\\nDid the government falter in assessing the Covid situation? Who is at fault?\\nAbsolutely. The Prime Minister is at fault. He runs a highly centralised and personalised government machinery, is solely and substantially devoted to building his own brand, is utterly focused on imagery rather than substance. The fact is that this Government completely failed to understand or to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic -- right from the very beginning, despite repeated warnings. Since the very start of this pandemic back in 2020, I kept trying to warn the government about the disaster ahead if we did not urgently prepare but they attacked me and ridiculed me. It\\'s not just me - anyone who tried to sound the alarm, the state callously and thoughtlessly ignored. Modi government let this virus enter India through our airports in February and March of 2020. And then it panicked and without consultation or thought imposed the world\\'s harshest lockdown. Migrant workers were left to fend for themselves and an unprecedented exodus began from the cities. The poorest of the poor were forced to walk hundreds of kilometres home with no support, no aid, no assistance. In his sheer ignorance, the Prime Minister said he would defeat the virus in 21 days, akin to the battle of Mahabharata! Modi government is plainly arrogant and focuses on perception over reality- declaring victory against the virus is absolute insanity and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the nature of what this virus is. The only way to fight corona is with humility and by realizing that you are faced with a relentless opponent, who can adapt and is very resilient. The PM had an entire year to better prepare, protect India, and think through this crisis but what did they do? Did the PM & the Govt add sufficient oxygen capacity, ramp up testing, increase hospital beds, ventilators? Did the PM think long-term about the state of our health infrastructure and start building for the sort of subsequent Corona waves that almost every country in the world was experiencing? It was sheer luck that we emerged out of last year\\'s nightmare, to a point where we had less than 10,000 new cases in a day early in 2021. We were not testing enough then. We are not testing enough now. Where was the preparation for this massive second wave? Why were the jumbo facilities put up last year dismantled? Why did they raise oxygen exports over 700% - think of that number, 700% - in the months before this brutal second wave?\\n\\nWhat could the Government have done differently to address the second wave?\\nThe Modi Government was both grossly negligent and blindly overconfident. The BJP announced the end of the pandemic and congratulated the Prime Minister for his \"success\" even as the second wave was just beginning. The Prime Minister himself is on record as having said that India had successfully fought the pandemic and won. In reality, there was no coherent strategy. One, the government should have built massive capacity over the last year -- testing, oxygen, hospital beds, ventilators. Two, they should not have declared victory prematurely. Three, the Prime Minister and his government did not even acknowledge there was a problem. How can you fix something you don\\'t even accept exists? Four, the government did not act on scientific advice or evidence. They continuously ignored rising cases and were busy instead with election campaigns. They encouraged super-spreader events. They even bragged about them. Our Prime Minister and Home Minister were not even wearing masks in public over the past few months. What sort of a message is that sending to citizens? Five, most importantly, the only solution we have is vaccination. We are supposed to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world. And yet, India is desperately short of vaccines. We are making them, why weren\\'t our people first in line to be vaccinated? If that is not a failure to plan and execute, what is?\\n\\nWith India seeing around 4 lakh cases a day, the highest in the world, is there a case for the national emergency considering the unprecedented crisis?\\nWe are already in the midst of a national emergency. But just declaring something is not the answer. The biggest problem of this government is it announces and then absconds. Now that the situation is completely out of control, they have dropped the ball and thrown it to the states. They have made the states and citizens truly \\'Aatmanirbhar\\'. Rely on yourself is the motto. No one will come to help you. Definitely, not the Prime Minister. The need of the hour is to hold hands, work together and heal our people. India must be the only country in the world facing this massive pandemic without the guidance of an expert and empowered group that is charged with fighting the virus and protecting the people, with planning ahead, anticipating needs and taking the decisions that will result in swift action to save lives.\\n\\nGoI has said it repeatedly warned states about the second wave and asked them to map the need for essential supplies like oxygen, ICU beds, and continue with containment efforts. Would you say the current situation is a collective failure of the Centre and states?\\nThe entire country has already been under the Epidemic Act for more than a year. The Centre has absolute power over states under the Act. This is a government that wants to control everything. When cases went down, they declared victory, and the Prime Minister took all the credit as he always does. Now that the situation is terrible, why are you blaming the states? Out of 162 oxygen plants sanctioned in October by the Centre, only 33 are functional. This was set up with the PM-CARES funds. The Modi Government took tens of thousands of crores of donations in his name, without any transparency, without any accountability. The states have rejected the sub-standard ventilators supplied by the Centre through these funds. States do not even get their GST dues on time. States are dependent on the Modi Government for quotas of oxygen, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections. The Modi Government has chained the hands of the states behind their backs, so they are completely powerless, and then asks them to sort out their own affairs. Obviously, the system will collapse.\\n\\nAdult vaccinations are starting on May 1 along the lines you demanded, but states say they cannot start as they do not have the vaccines. What is your view? Did you seek the expansion of vaccinations too early? The UK will start adult vaccines from June?\\nFirst, the government set a target of vaccinating 300 million by August. This is the above 45 age category. They managed to fully vaccinate not even 2 percent of the total population. With the mounting pressure of the government not vaccinating enough, they added another 600 million to the list, by starting vaccinations for the 18+ group from May 1. But where are the vaccines? Why did the Modi Government abandon the people between age groups of 18 to 44 years by refusing to take responsibility for their vaccination? Why is there a discriminatory policy on the pricing of vaccines? Why should there be five different prices for the same vaccine? What is the strategy beyond two companies? How can that suffice for almost 1 billion people? We need 2 billion doses. Now, they are scrambling for vaccines. The numbers just don\\'t add up.\\n\\nYou have said the liberalised Vaccine policy is discriminatory. Vaccine makers have reduced prices for states. Your comments?\\nThis is the story of \\'discount sale\\', where you mark up the price, and then make a show of reducing it. It is a complete eyewash. Why should states pay more than the Centre to buy vaccines? Why should the states be left to fend for themselves? Why should there be a difference in price for vaccines for the Centre, the States and the private hospitals? Why should the price of the vaccine even for the two companies be different? Why the discrepancy? After all, even when States pay for the vaccination of those between the age groups of 18 to 44 years, it is taxpayer\\'s money.\\n\\nThe government has not invoked compulsory licensing for vaccines despite repeated calls by Congress?\\nDr Manmohan Singh asked for compulsory licensing in his letter to the Prime Minister. The Congress President has repeated it several times now. Other countries have done this. The USA ramped up its vaccine production using their Defense Production Act. We have to do whatever it takes, within our laws, to ramp up the domestic production of vaccines here. We have a domestic manufacturing base. We can manufacture for both India and the world. All the industry needs are licenses and raw materials. It should have been done months ago.\\n\\nThe Congress party has said it is willing to work together with the Centre in the fight against Coronavirus. How will you make it accountable then?\\nCongress Party has said from day one that it is willing to work with the government in the fight against Coronavirus and for a year now, even in just the last few days, the Congress President has repeated this position very clearly. We have been consistently giving suggestions on all possible forums. Forget taking them seriously, the government has not even meaningfully acknowledged these suggestions. I see no contradiction in working together with the government in times of unprecedented crisis while at the same time holding it accountable for its decisions. The problem arises when the government doesn\\'t believe in consultation, in carrying everyone along, in tapping expertise it lacks. This government seems to think that acknowledging help is needed is a sign of weakness. The hubris and pettiness of this government are unbelievable.\\n\\nThe Madras High Court has held the Election Commission responsible for the Covid situation. Your views?\\nThe Court was echoing a widely held view. In the past 7 years, like so many other institutions, the Election Commission of India has also crumbled. The Court has said what it believes, I don\\'t want to make any further comment. Let your readers judge for themselves. Our Institutions are a warning system- they give us feedback and information on how to respond to crisis but our institutions have been completely destroyed and taken over. The press, judiciary, election commission, bureaucracy - none of them have played their role of guardian/watchdog. This means India today is like a ship in a storm, sailing without any information. Corona is just part of the problem - the real problem is that India now doesn\\'t have the capacity to respond to any major crisis because of what has been done to its systems over the last 6 years.\\n\\nThere have been demands within for internal elections and a new Congress president? Are you ready to lead again in such times, especially when there are demands from various quarters within for you to lead?\\nI have always favoured internal organisational elections within the Congress and these will be conducted in time. It is for the party workers to decide as to who should lead the party. I will do whatever the party wants me to do. But right now the focus is on controlling the pandemic, saving lives, and alleviating India\\'s widespread suffering and pain. There will be time for everything else in due course.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRahul GandhiCongress LeadersHospital BedsModi GovtOxygen Supply\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n4 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nGuest Login\\n115 days ago\\nTimepass feku... no actions , no work , no ideas , no inspiration, no brain.... just words words words\\nKish Sh\\n117 days ago\\nWE AS INDIANS ASSURE YOU PROMPT CREMATORIUM AVAILABILITY ASAP ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBLIGE YOU.\\nShyam VS\\n119 days ago\\nWhen the nation is throwing everything it has on the monster, and praying for the best, Mr Gandhi comes to address the nation from his inherited pulpit.

       " 'Synopsis\\nA bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which held a four-hour-long special hearing on a holiday on various issues relating to the COVID-19 situation, said it appears there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes.\\nGetty Images\\nThe Delhi High Court Saturday directed all hospitals in the national capital to provide information on daily admissions and discharge of COVID-19 patients and of those admitted for over 10 days, since April 1. A concern was raised in the court regarding optimal utilisation of ICU and oxygenated beds and ICU beds in hospitals and nursing homes across Delhi.\\n\\nA bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which held a four-hour-long special hearing on a holiday on various issues relating to the COVID-19 situation, said it appears there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes.\\n\\n\"Looking into the dearth and shortage of beds, particularly oxygen beds and beds in ICU, we consider it necessary to have this aspect looked into as there are allegations of malpractice of patients not being discharged despite having recovered from the COVID-19 disease,\" the bench said.\\n\\nIt said, \"We direct the medical superintendents/ owners/ doctors of all hospitals and nursing homes, including those of Delhi government, Centre and private, to place details of the number of COVID-19 patients admitted and discharged each day from April 1.\"\\n\\nThey shall also give details of the number of patients who have remained hospitalised for 10 days or more and the type of bed occupied by them from April 1.\\n\\nThe bench said the details shall be emailed by May 4 to amicus curiae and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao who shall combine the information and place it before the court on May 5.\\n\\nIt also directed the Delhi government to forthwith update its portal about admission and discharge of COVID-19 patients from hospitals and to also keep it updated daily without fail.\\n\\nIt said the number of hospital beds available on the portal shall separately show how many of them are oxygenated and non-oxygenated.\\n\\n\"From what has emerged, it is well known that one who contracts COVID-19, takes about 10-14 days to recover in normal course... about 10 per cent of them require hospitalisation and 1 per cent of the total affected persons are likely to require greater medical intervention and admission to ICU,\" the court noted.\\n\\nDelhi government counsel Satyakam submitted that in Delhi, there are a total of 20,938 beds for COVID-19 patients as on date in all hospitals here and the data include non-oxygenated, oxygenated, ICU beds.\\n\\nTo this, the bench said looking to this number, every day a substantial number of beds should become available for the patients, but that does not appear to be happening.\\n\\nThe patients who require hospitalisation with oxygen support should normally be in a position to leave the hospital within 8-10 days subject to the condition, unless it worsens and requires ICU, the court said, adding that in most cases, COVID-19 resolves itself in 10 days to two weeks with medicines.\\n\\n\"However it appears that there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes,\" the bench said.\\n\\nSenior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, showed an office order by Directorate General of Health Services on the new discharge policy and also a document of the medical director of LNJP Hospital which stated that patients are staying in hospitals beyond seven days.\\n\\n\"\"Therefore, all unit heads and consultants are requested to discharge patients as per the revised discharge policy of the government so that more lives can be saved. Stable patients whose oxygen saturation is more than 91 per cent may be shifted to GNEC, Shehnai banquet and Rouse Avenue School,\" the hospital order said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the court also said hospitals should learn from their experiences regarding oxygen scarcity during the prevailing pandemic and set up plants for generating the life-saving gas.\\n\\nIt said for commercial considerations, some hospitals reduce capital expenditures on things like oxygen plants which are essential in a hospital, especially the big ones, and it is irresponsible not to have such plants.\\n\\nMehra also informed the court that a hospital in the name of Gandhi Hospital on Friday made a false statement that it has not received a single oxygen cylinder for the last 48 hours, despite getting various.\\n\\nThe hospital\\'s owner submitted that there was some mis-communication between the management and their lawyer and there was no intention to make a false statement.\\n\\nThe court warned that such false claims shall not be made in future, particularly at this time as it wastes time and takes away time of the administration which is dealing with the situation on war footing.\\n\\nRegarding a plea by a group of lawyers including Bar Council of Delhi chairman Ramesh Gupta seeking arrangement for treatment of lawyers contracting COVID-19, Mehra said they were working on it and something positive will come up by Monday.\\n\\nAnother plea was mentioned by Dwarka Court Bar Association President Y P Singh seeking to make operation Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka, which has been under construction for the last 8 years and near completion now, which could accommodate 1700 beds.\\n\\nThe court asked the government to take instruction on this and apprise it with the development.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nBar Council Of DelhiCovidCovid PatientsDirectorate General Of Health ServicesDelhi High CourtLnjp Hospital\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe conglomerate said that besides the investment gains, profit also improved at all of its major divisions.\\nAP\\nA year earlier, Warren Buffett's Berkshire reported losing $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per share.\\nRELATED\\nSome little-known facts about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway\\nTopics Warren Buffett may touch upon at the Berkshire AGM today\\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire rebounds from pandemic's depths, buys back more stock\\nOMAHA: Hours before Warren Buffett was set to take the stage at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, the company on Saturday reported a nearly $12 billion profit in the first quarter a year after a major loss when the value of its stock investments plummeted because of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway said it earned $11.7 billion, or $7,638 per Class A share, during the first quarter as the paper value of its investment portfolio rebounded. A year earlier, Berkshire reported losing $49.7 billion, or $30,653 per share.\\n\\nThe conglomerate said that besides the investment gains, profit also improved at all of its major divisions - including insurance, utility, railroad, manufacturing and retail companies - as the economy continued to recover from the pandemic during the first three months of this year. But Berkshire said it can't predict how the coronavirus will affect the economy going forward.\\n\\nCFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she was surprised that Berkshire's many economically sensitive businesses didn't improve more given how much the economy has recovered, but that it looked like the company controlled costs well at its major divisions.\\n\\nBuffett has long said Berkshire's operating earnings offer a better view of quarterly performance because they exclude investments and derivatives, which can vary widely. By that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings improved to $7.018 billion, or $4,577.10 per Class A share. That's up from $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share a year ago.\\n\\nThe four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings of $3,792.36 per Class A share.\\n\\nBerkshire continued its streak of major stock repurchases by investing $6.6 billion in its own stock during the quarter. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company spent $25 billion on repurchases last year. Seifert said investors will applaud the significant buybacks.\\n\\nBut Berkshire is still sitting on $145.4 billion in cash and short-term investments because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company for several years.\\n\\n``They're just not really putting a lot of capital to work,'' Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said.\\n\\nLater Saturday, Buffett will spend several hours answering questions at an online version of Berkshire's annual meeting. Buffett will be joined by Berkshire vice chairmen Charlie Munger, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.\\n\\nInvestor Cole Smead said Berkshire has largely been sitting on the sidelines in recent years without making major investments, and he'd love to see the company get more active the next time the market swoons. When the pandemic devastated markets a year ago, Berkshire took a cautious approach.\\n\\n``We do not question whether Buffett and Munger have patience. That's obvious. The question is do they have any aggression. That's not obvious,'' Smead said.\\n\\nSeifert said Buffett and Munger may face some tough questions about Berkshire's lack of corporate policies on climate change and social justice issues. Buffett has said he is largely leaving it up to Berkshire's subsidiaries to address those issues.\\n\\n``I think investors have the right to know what their views are on these issues. And so far they have not really been forthcoming at all,'' Seifert said..\\n\\nWhat will be missing at Saturday's meeting will be the thousands of people who normally show up to hear from Buffett and Munger.\\n\\nThis was the second year in a row that Berkshire's meeting was on online-only affair because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year's event was moved outside of Omaha for the first time -- to Los Angeles to be near where the 97-year-old Munger lives.\\n\\nThe meeting usually draws 40,000 to Omaha, filling a 18,300-seat arena and every nearby overflow room. No other company matches those crowds.\\n\\nAuthor Bob Miles said he'll miss ``mingling with like-minded and self-selected shareholders'' and talking with executives who run Berkshire subsidiaries who routinely spend part of the meeting in their company's booth in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall that adjoins the arena. Berkshire companies like Geico insurance, See's Candy and Fruit of the Loom sell their products to shareholders each year.\\n\\nThe fun of the meeting isn't just for shareholders. Jim Weber, who runs Berkshire's Brooks Running, said he longs for the chance to compare notes with fellow Berkshire managers at the one annual event that brings together the leaders of the decentralized conglomerate's dozens of subsidiaries.\\n\\n``We certainly miss that opportunity to connect with our peers,'' said Weber, adding that he would likely watch some of this year's event from a treadmill or stationary bike.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWarren Buffett AGMBerkshire AGMWarren Buffett LiveWarren Buffett AddressWarren BuffettBerkshire Hathaway\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

They plan to build 1,000 such systems in the coming few weeks for various areas including villages. These don’t require electricity.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, IIT-Delhi also donated 110 oxygen cylinders used in various labs to the local administration, said Rao.\\n\\nhas come up with a solution to convert pressure-swing absorption (PSA) nitrogen plants to generate oxygen. It can produce oxygen at a purity level of 93-96%.\\n\\nAlumni from various parts of the world are stepping up, too. A group of five IIT-Kanpur alumni set up a fundraiser called Breathe India to procure oxygen concentrators for Delhi, and managed to raise Rs 2.7 crore in five days. The group now plans to raise another Rs 2-5 crore and has expanded to other cities in UP and Bihar.\\n\\nAnother group comprising two students and an alumnus of IIT-Bombay had started an initiative called HelpNow, which aims to cut the time it takes an ambulance to reach a patient in need.

       " 'Synopsis\\nElection rallies and others may have contributed a small fraction but please look at the totality and context of the overall behaviour seen in the country, even among enlightened sections of people, says Ashutosh Sharma.\\nWhile scientific studies are still on, the strains look more infective, says Ashutosh Sharma.\\nDepartment of Science & Technology secretary Ashutosh Sharma spoke to ET on the second wave of the pandemic, the new strains of the coronavirus, the lessons before us and the role of elections and Kumbh in spreading the infection. Excerpts:\\n\\nOn second wave alerts\\nOur own modelling studies and various other studies, none of them predicted the scale, intensity and the ferocity that we see now. The country was prepared for a surge of less than a lakh per day as a lot of resources were built in the first wave for it.\\n\\nThe ( supermodel) committee gave an informal alert in March and held its last meeting with ( member-health) Dr VK Paul on April 2 where the prediction was of India hitting the peak in the third-fourth week of April with an intensity of less than a lakh per day. Clearly what was predicted was far short of the reality, probably because inputs to the model changed — mutations in the virus which probably required less loading for the disease to take hold.\\n\\nI say clearly that there was no other input, and not one of them, that was an alarming input, as far as science is concerned.\\n\\n\\nand others may have contributed a small fraction but please look at the totality and context of the overall behaviour seen in the country, even among enlightened sections of people. It had become pervasive.\\n\\n\\nI don’t think one can fault the messaging. The messaging was always there. Mathematical models also clearly and emphatically said that the behaviour of the virus was linked to that of the people. It is a difficult situation, we cannot just be blaming each other. The important thing is to take charge of the situation and follow some simple things like masking as well as one can and ensuring adequate ventilation to check the spread of infection.\\n\\n\\nWhile scientific studies are still on, the strains look more infective. It is argued that the transmission is happening through aerosol. It is still under study how much viral load is leading to the onset of disease.\\n\\nComparatively, a small fraction is showing severe symptoms but it is not clear how that selection happens. Comorbidity and obesity are indicators. So was age but now it is shifting to a younger population that was not infected before — like fire to fuel. Several ongoing global studies and at our labs will give greater insight over time.\\n\\n\\nFirst, it educates us about the past. It is now clear if we did not have the lockdown last year, the onset would have been far worse.\\n\\nThe second wave also shows that we must be continuously prepared. We need to seed deep expertise and infrastructure in research, in modelling and crisis response. These are long-term studies that require matching resources as well.\\n\\n\\nWe are working in repurposing of oxygen plants and we have identified several startups and industries for oxygen production. Some new designs have also come up which we are sharing. However, the real bottleneck just now is supply and logistics. That is being addressed by expert groups.\\n\\n\\nWe had no inkling the scale would be so huge. While we were totally prepared, the intensity is too high. This is not in contradiction with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ idea. It is unprecedented scale and the need to supply at speed which is the determining factor here. We should do so (imports) in a crisis. All countries do it.',\n",
       " 'Synopsis\\nThere was initially a joint boycott announcement by the English Football Association, English Premier League, English Football League, Women’s Super League, Women’s Championship as well as player, manager and referee bodies, antidiscrimination group Kick It Out, and the Women In Football group.\\nAgencies\\nThe abuse Tottenham interim coach Ryan Mason received was after he suffered a fractured skull which forced him to retire at age 26 in 2018.\\nThere will be no goal clips, lineup announcements, banter between clubs or even title celebrations. Four days of silence across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram by football leagues, clubs and players in England began on Friday in a protest against racist abuse that has been adopted more widely. Such is the anger across the game, it means that if Manchester City clinches the Premier League on Sunday it will not celebrate the title on social media.\\n\\nWHO IS BOYCOTTING?\\nThere was initially a joint boycott announcement by the English Football Association, English Premier League, English Football League, Women’s Super League, Women’s Championship as well as player, manager and referee bodies, antidiscrimination group Kick It Out, and the Women In Football group. Ahead of the boycott which began at 1400 GMT (1930 IST) on Friday through 2259 GMT on Monday (0430 IST Tuesday), other English sports including cricket, rugby, tennis and horse racing said they would fall silent on social media.\\n\\nFIFA, UEFA and the Premier League’s British broadcasters also said they wouldn’t post online across four days.\\n\\nPrince William, who is president of the FA, said on the Kensington Palace Twitter account he would be joining the boycott. Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, who is the only Black driver on the grid, announced he wouldn’t post during the Portuguese Grand Prix weekend to help “make a difference for future generations.” The International Tennis Federation joined the boycott in the hope it stops vile abusive messages, including death threats, being sent to players, coaches and officials.\\n\\nWHY PROTEST?\\nThe English players’ union led a move to boycott social media for 24 hours in 2019 — called the “Enough” campaign — to demand tougher action to stop hatred being sent online to their members. It hasn’t come, with no zero tolerance. For Facebook-owned Instagram, a racist post isn’t enough to get a user immediately suspended.\\n\\n“It’s dreadful,” said Simone Pound, head of equalities at the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA). “When we first went to them after the Enough campaign I had reams and reams of the examples of the abuse players are receiving. We had (Leicester captain) Wes Morgan in the room talking from a personal level. There was the N-word everywhere, monkey emojis everywhere and they were like, ‘We’re really sorry. It doesn’t contravene our community guidelines.”’\\n\\n\\n\\nNot much has improved after two years, according to Pound. “Since we first met with them, they appreciate that isn’t a good enough response or answer,” Pound said. “However, we are still seeing and know that those words, those emojis are being used in a horrific way, daily to players and they aren’t always being taken down quickly. Sometimes they are still up six months after being reported.”\\n\\nInstagram’s moves to eradicate racism have focused on action against abusive direct messages more than public posts.\\n\\nTWITTER INACTION\\nThe PFA found that 31 out of 56 racist and discriminatory tweets remain live on Twitter as of Thursday despite reporting them last year. Like Facebook, Twitter would not provide anyone for interview to discuss claims they are strengthening moves to remove discriminatory content and abusive users.\\n\\nA study by the anti-discrimination Fare network with Belgium-based artificial intelligence company Textgain found that 157 players involved in the quarterfinals of the Champions League and Europa League last August received discriminatory abuse on Twitter. Six months later, 66% of discriminatory tweets remained online as did 71% of the accounts, Fare said, pointing out that while ethnic minority players receive more racist abuse, there is homophobic abuse sent to players across the game.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT ACTION\\nThe British government is introducing a law to address online safety that could lead to social media companies being fined for failing to crack down on racism. “We could see fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden wrote in Friday’s edition of The Sun newspaper.\\n\\n“For a company such as Facebook or YouTube, that could be billions.”\\n\\nMANAGERS\\nThe boycott started as managers were holding news conferences ahead of the weekend’s matches. Wolverhampton’s Nuno Espirito Santo, the only Black manager in the Premier League, flagged issues about withdrawing from public information platforms.\\n\\n“Not everyone on social media uses it badly,” he said of the boycott. “You’ve to balance and we can’t compromise our freedom, but at the moment I think it’s a good measure.”\\n\\nThe abuse Tottenham interim coach Ryan Mason received was after he suffered a fractured skull which forced him to retire at age 26 in 2018.\\n\\n“I had to zone out of it and had to take myself off social media as a player because I didn’t want to see it,” Mason said. “Even after I retired I’d get messages about my injury and certain things, and you almost think it’s another message and I’ll just ignore it. But these things shouldn’t be acceptable.”\\n\\nBANNED BY CLUBS\\nManchester United announced on Friday that six fans have been banned for racially abusing Tottenham forward Son Heung-min on social media. United also found in a review of Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that 3,300 abusive posts were aimed at their players from September 2019 to February 2021. Chelsea also said that a supporter had been banned for 10 days for antisemitic posts.\\n\\nWHAT’S NEXT?\\nThe PFA is preparing for more blackouts on social media. “I personally feel this could be the first of a series of boycotts,” Pound said. “We can do this every week if we have to. This is not going away. They have to listen to us.”\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nGovernmentUnitedUefaSocial MediaChampions LeaguePremier League\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " 'Synopsis\\nVaccinating all adults, some 90 crore Indians, is fraught with multiple challenges. These include a massive shortage of jabs, friction between the Centre and some states, confusion arising out of differential pricing and, above all, the severity of the current wave, which has jammed the nation’s healthcare infrastructure and even forced many youngsters to worry whether vaccination centres could emerge as super spreading spots.\\nReuters\\nAfter Nayana Achamma, a BA student in Kerala, cast her vote for the first time on April 6, she has been all agog to know the results of the assembly elections which will be out on May 2. But closer to the date, the anticipation for the results got supplanted by her eagerness for the Covid-19 vaccine, which opened for all adults from May 1.\\n\\n“Right now, I just want to get the vaccine as fast as possible,” says the 18-year-old. “The second wave has returned with a lot more intensity. The sooner we get the vaccine, the better, right?” she reasons. When registrations opened for everyone above 18 years on the at 4 pm on April 28, Achamma was able to register after multiple attempts but to her disappointment, did not get a slot. “I’ll try again,” she says.\\n\\nOn May 1, the day vaccination took off, only a few states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat could start the process, that too, symbolically, in a few districts. Most states missed the launch against a gloomy backdrop of acute vaccine shortage and a second surge of Covid-19 that has turned lethal, not sparing the younger lot, either.\\n\\nTill now, barely 2% of India’s 1.35 billion population — mainly healthcare and security personnel plus some senior citizens — have got both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccines. Only this tiny proportion is somewhat shielded from the brutal new wave that has plunged entire cities and villages in despair and mourning. About 100 million, i.e. less than 8% of the population, have taken only one dose. In the last 24 hours India saw over 4 lakh Covid cases, the highest single-day spike globally, and 3,523 deaths.\\n\\n\\nUnquestionably, at this juncture, vaccines are the basic armour against the virus and mass inoculation is the need of the hour. The very fact that 133 million citizens registered on the Co-WIN portal on April 28, the day people in the 18-44 years age cohort was permitted to enrol, demonstrates how younger Indians are willing and eager to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. However, vaccinating all adults, some 90 crore Indians, is fraught with multiple challenges. These include a massive shortage of jabs, friction between the Centre and some states, confusion arising out of differential pricing and, above all, the severity of the current wave, which has jammed the nation’s healthcare infrastructure and even forced many youngsters to worry whether vaccination centres could emerge as superspreading spots.\\n\\nCardiac surgeon and chairman of Medanta, , argues that hospitals still have enough capacity, appealing young Indians with no symptoms to come forth and get themselves vaccinated as early as possible. “Unlike the last time, the number of younger people who got infected and even died during this wave is out of proportion. I would like the younger lot to get vaccinated soon. Self-defence includes wearing a mask and getting vaccinated,” says Trehan, adding that the impact of the virus on those who have already got two shots is milder.\\n\\nShobana Kamineni, executive vicechairperson of , echoed a similar view when ET spoke to her last week. “The more we vaccinate, the less will be the problem. The pandemic has to be tamed just like a forest fire. Right now, the fire is everywhere. Once more and more people get vaccinated and acquire immunity, there will only be small eruptions here and there, and only those need to be clamped down,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is evident that scaling up of vaccination will alleviate the problem although it cannot immediately arrest the exploding number of cases as it takes time for immunity to build. The question is: How soon can India do that? Does India have enough vaccines to cover everyone above 18? In an email reply to ET’s queries, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), says his company is scaling up production capacity from the present level of 60-70 million doses per month. “By July we hope to produce 100 million doses monthly,” he says. SII has been manufacturing Covishield, one of the two vaccines currently in use in India, the other being Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.\\n\\nTo the question of SII’s commitment to states and private hospitals, Poonawalla replies he can’t share specific details at this juncture. “As per the recent GoI directive, 50% of our capacity will be reserved for the Union government and the remaining 50% will be for state governments and private hospitals. That said, at this stage, it would be difficult to share specific details.”\\n\\nMost states are aware they won’t receive adequate vaccine supplies to cater to the new demand. While BJP-ruled states are largely silent on the matter, those ruled by other parties, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, have openly expressed their anger and apprehension, saying they don’t have enough stocks. Nor have they received any firm commitment or timeline from suppliers to cover the age cohort of 18-44, they say. This is even as private hospital chains like Apollo, Fortis and Max began vaccination for this age group on May 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you probe a little more, the friction between the Centre and states comes to the fore. States that are not ruled by the BJP are worried about the possibility of the Centre taking the entire credit for the exercise even as it washes its hands of it and makes the states contribute to the cost of vaccines for 18-44-year-olds.\\n\\nHealth Minister of Chhattisgarh, TS Singh Deo, minces no words when he says: “It is petty to say so, but the certificate coming out of Co-WIN portal will have the prime minister’s photo. However, for vaccinating 18-plus, states will also pay. Our state, for example, is paying some Rs 1,000-1,200 crore. We wanted our own portal, but the Centre has not agreed to our proposal.” Chhattisgarh has placed an order for 25 lakh doses of Covishield and an equal quantity of Covaxin.\\n\\nVaccine supplies for the new phase have become more complicated with the Centre announcing that states will have to procure doses for the 18-44 years cohort directly from manufacturers. Vaccine makers have been instructed to reserve half the output for the Centre and the remaining doses for states and the private sector, with differential pricing for each. This is in contrast with the Union government’s policy on universal immunisation until now, with the Centre buying the doses and distributing it among the states. “All these decades, the central government always procured vaccines and supplied them to the states. Due to its huge market, India always got very competitive prices. In fragmented markets and at a time when the product is scarce and demand is high, the seller is at a huge advantage,” says K Sujatha Rao, former secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.\\n\\nAdditionally, to have 30 states enter into individual contracts, ensure supplies and do quality assurance checks would be duplication with no advantage and end up wasting huge amounts of time for overworked health departments, she argues Then there is the vexing issue of pricing, with the manufacturers announcing different prices for the Centre, states and the private sector. Vaccines that are directly imported, by private players or states, will be priced separately. Uttar Pradesh, for example, has announced that it would float a global tender to import 40 million doses.\\n\\n\\nIndian manufacturers have announced the price list. One dose of Covaxin will be sold for Rs 1,200 to private hospitals, Rs 400 to states and for Rs 150 to the Centre. As far as Covishield is concerned, SII is charging Rs 600 from private hospitals, Rs 300 from states and Rs 150 from the Centre.\\n\\n“A business that is in the business of earning profits will sell to one offering a higher price, in this case the private parties. So where do the states stand in the queue?” asks Rao. Considering India has so far practised equitable vaccination with the government procuring the vaccine for all government entities, there was no reason to deviate from that now, she says. “The private sector, if it so wishes, can collaborate with the government and provide the vaccine at a nominal fee or buy vaccines in India and abroad and make a variety available for those who can afford those prices,” she says.\\n\\nSII’s Poonawalla argues that charging higher rates from select customers is important as he would need more resources for ramping up the production capacities of his factories: “The initial supply price of Covishield for government programmes, including in India, has been the lowest. Private market price is 3-4 times higher. This is partly due to large volumes and because a majority of the population gets vaccinated for free through the government. We must, however, be able to sustain and reinvest in scaling up our capacity and save lives.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, India Inc has begun purchasing vaccines directly. ITC, for example, has decided to support all its eligible employees and their family members with vaccination under the company’s medical assistance policy, with support for vaccination also being extended to service providers and partners in the value chain across the country, according to Amitav Mukherji, head of the corporate human resources of the company.\\n\\nDr Satyajit Rath, an immunologist with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune, warns that vaccination will not have an immediate effect on the current, ongoing surge – “that will play out over the next few weeks since it takes at least three weeks after a vaccine dose for people to acquire any immunity”. “Covid-19 vaccine reduces the chances of catching infection, but does not make it zero, and reduces the chances of dying of Covid-19 even more, but does not make even that zero,” he adds, emphasising that there should be clear, sober messaging on vaccination.\\n\\nHowever, the biggest challenge now is simply the lack of supply of adequate doses of vaccines. While India produces about 80 million doses a month of Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines which have received emergency use authorisation, public health professionals say the situation will only exacerbate with the expansion of vaccination drive. “Neither Serum Institute nor Bharat Biotech will have adequate supplies in May. We have raised expectations and demand without sufficient supply — that’s going to hit state governments in a big way, unless they come out and say they are not going to start in May and that they will do so in June or July,” says Dr N Devadasan, who has worked in public health for over three decades and is currently a technical advisor to Health Systems Transformation Platform, set up by Tata Trusts.\\n\\nDr Rath, too, cautions against raising expectations at a time of severe shortage of vaccines. “Vaccination campaigns need to ensure the reliability of vaccine availability; the current situation of uncertainty where people make online appointments which are cancelled at the last moment or worse, end up with no vaccine supply at the centres, increase vaccine hesitancy. Not much may be promised, but what is promised needs to be delivered,” he says. With supplies likely to change from week to week, Dr Rath says states’ decision-making around the vaccine drive must be dynamic and flexible to accommodate this. He suggests that states must include in priority groups those at risk of serious outcomes of infection (such as the elderly and those with co-morbidities) and those with a high likelihood in major transmission points.\\n\\n\\nThe current vaccine policy could lead to inequity as well, as larger states might be able to negotiate a better price than others, says Dr Devadasan. “You could end up having huge variations among states. Also, some states have announced that they will give vaccines for free while others have not — will the latter be charging patients? That could then be a significant amount.” The Union government, he says, must intervene because vaccines are a public good.\\n\\n\\nGlobally, governments have been providing Covid vaccines to residents for free, including in the United States. Indonesia is one of the few countries which has allowed its private sector to pursue a separate plan to procure doses and launch vaccine drives but even there, companies cannot make employees pay for it. Though some people might be reluctant to risk infection by stepping out to get the vaccine, Dr Rath says chances of infection in a hospital or vaccination centre are less simply because masking and related rules are strictly enforced. “The locations where the infection is likely being transmitted are households and small social gatherings and marketplaces where masking and physical distancing are not well maintained.”\\n\\n\\nAnother hurdle in maximising vaccination, say experts, is the clause that 18-44-yearolds have to mandatorily register online. Dr Prashanth NS, a faculty member at the Institute of Public Health, says that in the previous phases, nearly everyone who came to get vaccinated at primary health centres in and around BR Hills in Karnataka’s Chamarajanagar district — the predominantly rural and tribal region where he is based — walked in, without prior registration. “Once you say registration is required, that will be a huge exclusionary barrier for several people who are more in need of the vaccine than others,” he says.\\n\\nIt’s meaningless to argue that there is high penetration of smartphones in rural areas because that does not immediately mean an ability to register and use apps. In and around BR Hills, for instance, Prashanth says there has not been much enthusiasm for the vaccine — in that context, the additional barrier of online registration will only hamper immunisation efforts. “Never in the history of our country have we required registration for vaccination. We’ve done vaccination very well with ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife) — why are we not leveraging that, instead of using apps?” he asks.\\n\\nOne concern flagged by Dr V Ravi, virologist and former professor at NIMHANS, is the low uptake of vaccination among elders. States, he suggests, could continue with the previous strategy of prioritisation, in the face of supply constraints. “At least 80% of elders should be saturated first, then those with co-morbidities and, finally, the youngsters.” This has been the strategy followed by countries like the UK where vaccination was finally opened to those below the age of 50 years in descending order of age after everyone in the priority category had got at least one dose.\\n\\nIn India, since the rollout of vaccines in mid-January, the jab graph formed humps with occasional falls in between due to supply shortage, festivals and the recent surge of Covid cases. With the rising Covid numbers and deaths in places like Delhi, the graph is worrying. It’s likely that the newly eligible cohort of 18-44 years will propel the jab graph northward once more. After all, vaccines are one ray of hope for Indians battling the pandemic.',\n",

He has put in a system after a lot of effort, but the administration on the ground has ruined it. District administrations are proving to be a failure”.\\n\\nHe said that after his communication, the tehsil administration has pulled up its socks and efforts are on now to bring the oxygen situation under control in the next couple of days, at least in Gola.\\n\\nLaw minister Brijesh Pathak was the first one to direct the state administration’s attention to the failing situation in Lucknow in terms of lack of bed and delays in medical care.\\n\\nBJP MP from Mohanlalganj Kaushal Kishore is also increasingly vocal about the on-ground chaos –– from highlighting how oxygen suppliers were not being supplied to private hospitals to directing the CM’s attention towards laxities being observed by prominent government hospitals in Lucknow to requesting the to postpone the panchayat elections that have allegedly claimed the lives of more than 700 teachers who were on duty.\\n\\nSimilarly, Meerut MP, Rajendra Agarwal had written to the CM about the glaring shortage of oxygen in the district which was preventing hospitals to accept new patients.\\n\\nEarlier this week, BJP MLA from Aurai, Bhadohi, Dinanath Bhaskar, wrote a letter to the CM calling for a probe into the Covid-related death of the BJP district secretary of Bhadohi. The leader passed away on April 27 in a government hospital in Bhadohi.

The rollout of the new phase began in certain pockets in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Odisha and in select centres of private hospital chains Apollo Hospitals, Max Healthcare and Fortis Healthcare.\\n\\nIn Mumbai, 1,000 people were inoculated, the target set by the city’s civic body, with this number to be raised to 2,500 on Sunday. “We decided to vaccinate 200 people from the 18-44 age category today at five centres and we have fully achieved this target. Each centre was supposed to vaccinate 200 people,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI.\\n\\nVaccination for this phase is only through prior registration with walk-ins disallowed. In New Delhi, Max Healthcare had said the drive would begin at some of its hospitals even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had made it clear the national capital would not join the rollout on Saturday as doses had not arrived. Apollo Hospitals sources told PTI that the immunisation at its hospitals in Delhi was likely to begin by Monday or Tuesday.\\n\\nThe Uttar Pradesh government began the “Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3” vaccinations in seven districts which had clocked over 9,000 Covid-19 cases each - Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Bareilly. Gujarat kicked off the new phase in 10 districts most affected by the pandemic, including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Gandhinagar.\\n\\nThe drive was launched in a limited number of districts as Gujarat has received only three lakh doses from the vaccine manufacturers as against the order of 2.5 crore doses placed by the state government, officials told PTI. Authorities in Ahmedabad said they have set up 76 vaccination centres. The rollout starts at a time when many states are reporting a shortage of vaccines though the Centre’s report available till 8 am on Saturday says over 79 lakh Covid vaccine doses are still available with the states and Union Territories to be administered.\\n( Originally published on May 01, 2021 )\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUddhav ThackerayKarnatakaMaharashtraSerum Institute Of IndiaBharat BiotechVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",
       " 'Synopsis\\nRobert O. Mendelsohn teaches environmental economics at Yale University.\\nET Bureau\\nRobert O. Mendelsohn teaches environmental economics at Yale University. Speaking to ET, he discusses President Joe Biden’s 2030 timeline for the US to halve its greenhouse gas emissions, the likely impacts of climate change on India — and the importance of global synergy in climate mitigation schemes:\\n\\nPresident Biden has announced a 2030 target for the US to halve its emissions — which American industries are likely to change most rapidly?\\nThis depends on the programs President Biden can actually implement — his first target will be to incentivise American utilities to go as carbon-free as possible by 2030. His second target will be transportation. However, this is a much more difficult sector to wean away from oil, gasoline and diesel than power as these fuels are much cheaper relatively for transport. Switching to electricity-based transportation will be more expensive and harder to accomplish. Major emitters in manufacturing will also be affected. But President Biden’s overall chances of success will be tied to the cooperation he gets from the legislature which wi l l need to support more efficient mitigation mechanisms like carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes.\\n\\nWhat is your assessment of the economic impacts of climate change on India?\\nMy research indicates that the bulk of global climate damages will bear down worryingly on low latitude countries like India. Countries like India which are closer to the equator could endure up to 80% of the global damage of climate impacts. The primary reason therefore to think of climate change as a global challenge is to help reduce the damage in such countries. Ironically, it’s hard to convince many countries to invest in climate mitigation because they don’t want to spend on something that seems to benefit another nation — this behaviour makes it harder to stop climate change.\\n\\nAgencies\\n\\nWhat are some recommendations you’d make to developed economies on mitigating global climate change?\\nI would first suggest establishing a carbon tax on emissions. This should be taxed at around ten dollars a ton of carbon. It should apply to main emitters and most mid-to high latitude economies, which are not going to be as hard hit by climate impacts, would thereby have to spend more on mitigation. Some countries are very poor and it would be unfair to burden them with the extra costs of climate mitigation. The world should help poorer households in those countries pay their share of mitigation costs — the energy expenditures of a poor household can be estimated and richer groups can increase climate aid to compensate for the higher costs of their moving to clean energy.\\n\\nThe science is extremely clear. Why are there still so many roadblocks in the path of mitigating climate change?\\nThere are two main reasons. Firstly, most mitigation schemes are still very expensive. And as much as most people would like to see climate change disappear, they are not willing to make a sacrifice to do this. Mitigations do require sacrifices in terms of lifestyles, profits, investments into renewables and so on. The second reason is that climate change is a global problem and not a national one. Even if India were to make huge reductions in its emissions, that won’t change the climate situation of India — it is only if the entire world were to make huge reductions that India’s climate situation would change. We don’t have global governance for this. Yet, this needs good global decisions.\\n\\nThe situation calls for a different approach now. I’d like to see every country do something about their own emissions — each nation should intensively research how it can reduce emissions inexpensively. Each country should establish a national carbon reduction target and find affordable solutions to reach this. That would be a practical start. The problem is that climate change is often approached by envisioning dramatic mitigation steps — but these are very expensive, so, in fact, few people want to carry these out. Most people in reality end up doing nothing at all. But there are also relatively affordable mitigations that will help us get started. To solve global climate change, we need a realistic middle ground between wanting to do nothing and trying to do too much.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nYale UniversityJoe BidenClimate MitigationEmissionsCarbon Tax\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\nANI\\nCOVID-19 CASES\\nWorld\\nIndia\\nConfirmed\\n32,695,030\\nDeaths\\n437,830\\nJaspreet Rai is desperately trying to do her part for the country she left more than 30 years ago: help its people breathe.\\n\\nRai, 53, who moved to Endicott, New York -- the birthplace of IBM -- from Punjab, in India, is the founder of Sanrai International, a provider of oxygen concentrators. With India now the epicenter of the pandemic, counting about 3,500 Covid-19 deaths daily, and oxygen supplies running out, Rai has rushed to help her former homeland cope with its worst crisis in recent history.\\n\\n“This is probably the hardest time they’re going through,” Rai said of her 100-strong staff on the ground, who will supply 30,000 units across India in May, several times the 1,500 Sanrai normally provides in a year. “When you don’t have equipment, and you’re trying to hold people, and they’re gasping, literally gasping for air. And you’re like, look, I’ve sold my last unit, I have to wait until the next stock comes in.”\\n\\nLike Rai, millions of Indians spread across the globe -- one of the world’s largest diasporas -- are trying to do what they can to help their country of origin as heart-wrenching images of people lining up for oxygen cylinders, waiting outside hospitals for a bed or huddling around funeral pyres flash across their screens. Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\n\\nThe number of daily new coronavirus cases in India on Saturday topped the 400,000 mark for the first time, pushing the total infections to more than 19 million. That milestone was crossed on a day when the nation opened its vaccination program to all adults.\\n\\nFeeling Helpless\\nThe diaspora is collecting funds, lobbying governments in countries where they reside and making pledges to shuttle essential supplies and equipment. But the scale of the task is leaving many feeling helpless as the health-care infrastructure in the world’s second-most populous country teeters on the brink of collapse.\\n\\n“They need doctors and hospitals,” said Venktesh Shukla, general partner at Monta Vista Capital in Silicon Valley. “I’ve been struggling for the last three to four days to figure out what to do. Like a lot of Indians, we want to do something. We just can’t find a short-term solution to help.”\\n\\nIn spite of that frustration, the need to “do something” in the face of the unfolding tragedy is spurring many into action.\\n\\nLike Sudhir Ravi. Little did Ravi know he would be embarking on a humanitarian mission when the Chicago-based private equity boutique TJM Capital Partners, where he is an operating partner, bought the largest U.S. supplier of military-grade oxygen generators in a strategic acquisition in April.\\n\\nBut with Covid raging, Ravi soon identified 11 industrial strength oxygen concentrators between the U.S. and Germany that can be distributed to hospitals in India. The devices can offer oxygen to 50,000 people in the next six months.\\n\\nFor the last week, he and Raghu Gullapalli, a close contact and executive director at the LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, have been frantically looking for ways to get them to India, requesting the services of Amazon and FedEx. A consortium of Indian philanthropists have committed to cover the $100,000 cost of shipment, and Ravi said they’re hoping to get the cargo in the air on May 5.\\n\\n“Right now, time is measured in lives,” said Gullapalli.\\n\\nBillionaire Action\\nIndian-born billionaires and executives are also piling in with help. Tech investor Vinod Khosla tweeted that he’s willing to send supplies by the “planeload.” Google, headed by Sundar Pichai, promised $18 million in cash assistance to victims’ families and medical equipment. Microsoft Corp., led by CEO Satya Nadella, pledged to draw on the company’s network to provide essential supplies.\\n\\nIn the U.K., home to around two million Indians, aid has come from people like steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Karan Bilimoria, who helped draw support from companies as the first Indian head of the Confederation of British Industry.\\n\\n“We are focused on getting this help that is desperately needed as quickly as possible,” said Bilimoria, whose company produces Cobra beer, a staple of Indian restaurants in the U.K. Air Liquide SA, the French gas supplier that helps create the bubbles in Bilimoria’s beer, has pledged its oxygen production in India to support Covid patients.\\n\\nMittal’s Indian operations are providing 210 metric tons of liquid oxygen a day. “Helping the people of India means helping India, and that’s crucial for the entire world,” he said in an emailed statement.\\n\\nThe charitable foundation of U.K.-based billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought supermarket chain Asda, donated 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) to four hospitals in the western Indian state of Gujarat, from where their family hails.\\n\\nVaccine Woes\\nAs life in the U.K. and the U.S. edges ever closer to pre-pandemic normal, for Indians abroad worrying about family and friends, the unequal access to vaccines is becoming evident. Only 2% of the people in India have been fully vaccinated compared with 30% in the U.S. and 21% in the U.K., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.\\n\\nMonta Vista’s Shukla said he and 60 other influential Indians lobbied to convince the Joe Biden administration to free up vaccine supplies and steroids. The U.S. has decided to start shipping drugs like AstraZeneca’s vaccine and Remdesivir to India.\\n\\nYet for all that, there’s only so much even powerful Indians can do remotely as raw material and equipment shortages, freight delays and labor limits hamper efforts on the ground.\\n\\n“There’s only so many oxygen concentrators available in the market,” said Jitesh Gadhia, a British politician and a trustee of the British Asian Trust who has helped lead the U.K. government’s response and engagement with suppliers. “I am concerned that so many people trying to buy a limited stock will just raise prices. What we need is more supply.”\\n\\nAnd that won’t be easy. While in Endicott Rai is trying to find charter flights to get around bottlenecks to transport her oxygen concentrators to India from China, she said units her company can provide in a month “could probably just be used in one day.”\\n\\nRai, who started her company after her asthmatic grandmother died in 2008 needing oxygen, said she’s saddened by the continued fight in India over something as essential as the air one breathes.\\n\\n“I couldn’t understand how something so basic as oxygen was so complicated,” she said. “And that question is what I’ve been trying to answer for the past 13 years.”\\n\\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin and Gina Turner.\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAmazonCovidIBMRaviCoronavirusGoogleRemdesivirPandemic\\n9 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nZillionaire\\n119 days ago\\nWonderful and very creditable.

The investment companies technically fall under the definition of ‘deemed ’ - and will hence be regulated by RBI.\\n\\nMost HNIs use investment vehicles to invest their personal wealth in an array of investments. Many hold equities in some of their listed companies through investment arms. “Some investment companies set up by ultra-rich HNIs for investments in listed and unlisted space fall under the definition of ‘deemed NBFCs’ and are regulated by the RBI,” said , managing partner at law firm SNG & Partners. “Most of these companies neither borrow a single penny nor lend money to third parties.”\\n\\nSeveral corporate and individuals have undertaken massive restructuring exercises to avoid being regulated by the central bank. As per the RBI data, there are 64 companies registered as CIC, including companies owned by Tatas, Aditya Birla, and . Mails sent to Tata group, Aditya Birla group, Bharti Airtel and JSW on Thursday did not elicit any response as of press time Friday. Apart from these 64 companies, most promoters and investors who have not registered their investment arms with the RBI will also be impacted.\\n\\nRBI has put certain conditions for considering any company as an NBFC even if it’s not into lending. These include if a company holds 90% of its assets in the form of equity shares and its asset size is more than Rs 100 crore. “Many HNIs had invested through companies and the net worth of these companies had skyrocketed in the last one year, resulting in them falling under a de-facto definition of NBFC,” said Uday Ved, partner at tax advisory firm KNAV. “These companies will now have to be restructured in a way that they do not fall under the technical definition of a deemed NBFC, but in all practical purposes these companies are not NBFCs.”\\n\\nThe fear is that if RBI was to regulate these investment arms, then this could lead to legal complications. In most cases, promoters want to make sure that either they restructure the investment arms as non-companies or add additional layering so that it doesn’t technically become a CIC. Many investors who have not registered their companies with the RBI are not aware that their investment arms are now technically NBFCs, legal experts said.\\n\\nWhile the impact is on large investors, the spurt in the stock markets in the last one year also means that several investors have seen their investment arms cross the Rs 100-crore mark, experts said.',\n",

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan-an anti-Pakistan militant group-was weakened by leadership losses, but recently announced its reunification with two splinter groups to bolster its capabilities,\" he said.\\n\\n\"While Pakistani intelligence continues to provide material support and safe haven to the Taliban, Islamabad continues to support Afghan peace efforts, encouraging the Taliban to engage in dialogue with the Afghan Government,\" he added.\\n\\nBerrier said that Pakistan\\'s relations with India continue to remain tense since New Delhi\\'s August 2019 revocation of Kashmir\\'s semiautonomous status.\\n\\nDuring the year, tensions with India probably will remain elevated, and concerted efforts by both sides to fully implement the February 25, 2021 ceasefire will be necessary to reduce tension along the Line of Control.\\n\\nPakistan perceives nuclear weapons as key to its national survival, specifically to counter the threat from India\\'s growing conventional force superiority, and likely will increase its nuclear stockpile in 2021.\\n\\nTo that end, Pakistan continues to modernise and expand its nuclear capabilities by conducting training with its deployed weapons and testing developmental missiles.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNarendra ModiIndian ArmyIndian NavyTalibanLine Of ControlForeign PolicyIndia\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n5 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nMuthukrishna Pitchumani\\n118 days ago\\nInsteasd of Modi if congo regime had been there, xiping would have been our present indian prime minister, india every part from north to south one by one, for filling congi coffers, being sold to PLA under MOU from Congi under the able leadership of Pappu and PC, keeping hundreds of more crores in virgin islands.\\nValerian Pereira\\n119 days ago\\nwhen the U.N and the world body is just watching..The aggressor.. trespassing our LAC..LAxman Rekha what are we expected to do?Its about time that inndia too work on Cber..AI..All High tech..defense projects and defend our Land and also protect the International communityas these big guys simply..walk into an Annexe what they want.where they wantHow?why?Time to be extremely Aggressive. and put the enemy in place.\\nBadri Vinayak\\n120 days ago\\n4 chinese soldiers?

The stock goes straight to hospitals from the distributors under supervision of the state government. In this chain of supply, the chemists are not involved, so they can\\'t be blamed for hoarding.\"\\n\\nElaborating on a large scale requirement of life saving drugs for critical Covid patients, Rajiv Singhal said that taking note of daily cases of around 3.75 lakh in India, at least 70,000 patients would need a Remdesivir injection. \"As each patient requires 6 vials, the country would need over 4 lakh Remdesivir injections every day. We hope as most manufacturers have ramped up their production, the crisis of short supply of Remdesivir would be over,\" the General Secretary of AIOCD added. According to him, other medicines like Fabiflu and Tocilizumab were also in shortage due to sudden surge in demand. In many cases stock is not reaching chemists. Besides there were problems in procuring raw material for manufacturing Fabiflu which comes from abroad.\\n\\nOn shortage of Betadine gargle, recommended for prevention of Covid-19 by many doctors, Rajiv Singhal said that due to a surge in demand of Betadine, its manufacturing company could not meet the present requirement of the market. \"Let me tell you, people who need one bottle of Betadine, now buy 4 bottles. Everyone who can afford, wants to store such drugs. Actually this type of mindset of storing crucial medicines at home, is the reason behind the present shortage of certain medicine since the past one month.

With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Pfizer Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAbout 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts\\' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.\\n\\nSome strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\n\"The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that\\'s because you\\'re seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there\\'s still more room,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\\n\\nThe high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.\\n\\nCiting stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index was last at about 4,180.\\n\\nStocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.\\n\\nEarnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.\\n\\nHowever, \"tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That\\'s what I find amazing,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.\\n\\n\"Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,\" he said. Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard, Cummins Inc, ConocoPhillips and Pfizer Inc .\\n\\nThe first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.\\n\\nValue has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index is up about 8% in that time.\\n\\nTechnology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Apple Inc at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\nTech is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.\\n\\nWhile the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.\\n\\n\"It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\\n\\n\"We\\'re actually carving out a third group ... defensives,\" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWall Street OutlookConocoPhillipsRefinitivPfizerJPMorgan Chase & CoPfizer IncWells Fargo Investment InstituteApple IncCredit Suisse Securities\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\nBy John Kemp\\n\\nLONDON: The US Federal Reserve has signalled it will tolerate faster inflation for a time to cement the post-pandemic recovery and boost employment, but the side effect is likely to be a faster rise in commodity prices.\\n\\nThe central bank appears anxious to avoid a repeat of the slow expansion and job gains that followed the financial crisis of 2008 by adopting a more aggressive approach to stimulating the recovery.\\n\\nIn March, non-farm employment was still down by more than 8 million jobs compared with its pre-pandemic peak in February 2020, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving a large jobs gap to be filled.\\n\\nAfter its latest meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed it will seek to achieve the twin objectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run.\\n\\nThe committee noted price rises have been running persistently below target, so it aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time to make up the shortfall and anchor expectations at around the 2% level.\\n\\nBut if the Fed leaves rates low to target the slackest part of the economy - the labour market - it must intensify pressure on capacity and prices in other parts of the economy, including manufacturing and raw materials.\\n\\nINFLATION AVERAGING\\nProposals for medium-term inflation-averaging have been winning adherents for some years, but the committee appears to be planning something more ambitious - an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\n\\nThe plan is to run the economy hot to achieve faster job gains, especially among disadvantaged groups that are marginally attached to the labour force, before shifting back to inflation control later in the cycle.\\n\\nBut the resulting pressure on global supply chains while the Fed pursues employment increases is likely to generate significantly quicker price rises for raw materials and a range of manufactured items.\\n\\nBased on breakeven rates, bond traders are anticipating US consumer prices will rise at an average rate of 2.4% over the next ten years, compared with a realised average of 1.7% per year over the last decade.\\n\\nFor much of the last decade, expected inflation has been higher than the outturns, implying traders tend to overestimate price pressures.\\n\\nBut bond traders are probably correct for now, reacting to signs the Fed is prepared to tolerate significantly faster inflation to achieve faster employment gains.\\n\\nIS THERE AN UNDERSHOOT?\\nIn its statement, the Fed repeated its previous concerns about a persistent undershoot in the inflation rate, but there is no evidence for this, at least not since the middle of the last decade.\\n\\nPrice levels and inflation rates show no significant lasting impact from the coronavirus epidemic and recession in 2019, in contrast to the prolonged fall after the recession in 2008/09 and the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.\\n\\nConsumer prices have risen at an average rate of just over 2% per year over the last two years, three years and five years, according to the all-items consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nThe only evidence for a persistent undershoot is the 1.7% increase over the last ten years, influenced by unusually slow price increases between 2013 and early 2016.\\n\\nBased on the all-items consumer price index, both the rate of inflation and the level of consumer prices are in line with their long-term trend, and there is no undershoot to make up.\\n\\nThe Fed prefers more specialised measures of inflation, including the deflator for personal consumption expenditures, which is part of the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nPCE inflation has been running at 1.6-1.8% per year over the last two, three and five-year periods, and as little as 1.5% over the last ten years, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nBut PCE inflation has been below 2% almost continuously since 2014, so if the Fed wants to make up for all that undershooting, it implies much faster price increases for an extended period.\\n\\nTIGHT SUPPLY CHAINS\\nThe problem with the Fed’s new inflation averaging strategy is that it fails to specify the historical baseline from which deviations are being measured.\\n\\nWhen exactly did consumer prices move below their desired level and how much of that deviation does the central bank want to reverse and over what time horizon?\\n\\nThe lack of clarity is probably intentional since it gives the central bank flexibility to interpret if the target has been achieved and when to start tapering its bond-buying programme and raising interest rates.\\n\\nBut the strategy strongly suggests the central bank has a relatively high tolerance for faster inflation at the moment and wants to allow the economy to run hot, creating lots of jobs, for a long period.\\n\\nWith the Fed focused on maximum employment creation, it is almost inevitable global supply chains and manufacturing systems will remain stretched, generating upward pressure on goods prices and raw materials.\\n\\nNot since the 1960s has the Fed been so intensely focused on employment, when there was strong growth in output, but which eventually ended with a sharp acceleration in inflation at the end of the decade and in the 1970s.\\n\\nFor the central bank, the hope is that running the economy hot will encourage investment in additional capacity in the manufacturing and commodities sectors, creating jobs and dampening price increases over time.\\n\\nThere is a fine line between running hot and overheating, and if the central bank ends up on the wrong side, there will eventually have to be painful interest rate increases to tackle it.\\n\\nIn the meantime, high levels of consumer and business spending are likely to keep most commodities in short supply through 2021 and 2022, keeping upward pressure on raw materials and manufacturing prices.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUS Consumer PricesCommodity PricesTight SupplyUS Federal ReserveEconomyFederal Open Market CommitteeUS Bureau Of Economic AnalysisInflation\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

BJP will win 70 seats while its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) will suffer reverses and will settle for just eight seats. BJP in Assam had set a target of winning 100 plus seats for the assembly polls of 2021. Most exit polls have hinted at BJP retaining power in Assam. “BJP on its own will get a majority and will win 70 seats, while its ally AGP will win eight seats, United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) will win five seats,” Assam BJP president Ranjit Kumar Dass told media persons in Guwahati.\\n\\n“Together with allies, we will get 83 seats in the 126-member assembly. There are 21 seats which are doubtful, and we are expecting from these seats we will garner at least three seats and our tally will touch 86. In Barak valley we will get seven seats,” he said. There are 15 seats in Southern Assam’s Barak valley. In 2016, BJP had won eight seats, while All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) won four and Congress three seats.

Assam had a three-phase assembly poll and counting of ballots will take place on May 2. Congress cobbled up 10 parties led -Grand alliance (Mahajhot) to take on the BJP led alliance.

That was said by Maruti as well as Bajaj Auto NSE 0.22 %. It is going to remain a concern for some time to come despite what they may have delivered in quarterly numbers. How do you read into this commentary?\\nIf the commodity prices keep surging and staying there, then it is much easier to pass on because typically commodity prices account for 20-25% in an automobile. In a Rs 5-lakh Maruti car, if Rs 1 lakh is commodity price and even if it is subsidised by 20%, still 5-6% will be added to the sales price. Once it can be passed on, some margin sacrifice will be there but I do not see a 20% increase in the sales price.\\n\\nThe auto sector has gone through some crazy times in transitioning from BS IV to BS VI and on top of it, the 28% GST and now there is a slowdown. It is a very important manufacturing base. This year will not be a great year for autos broadly.\\n\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Tata Steel Ltd moved up by 1 in 6 months on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\nWhat about metals which have been wealth creators for investors? Yesterday, there was news that China will be removing that rebate of 13% VAT on steel exports from May 1. We have seen phenomenal gains across the board. Is it time for the commodity linked space to shine?\\nRight now they are shining like never before. So, I think there is a shortage of all kinds.\\n\\nNMDC, Tata Steel NSE 0.66 % are all rather active in today’s trading session.\\nThe capacity addition did not happen and the bumper demand for all kinds of durables had come back simultaneously. The low interest rates environment is also giving a chance. There is massive speculation in the commodities and demand is strong. It is all across. Plastics, steel, copper whatever is traded, is on fire. It is to do with the lot of liquidity sloshing around and demand being very strong after the Covid subsided in many parts of the world.\\n\\nOn the back of that, we have been talking about the cyclical theme versus defensives and the return possibility on cyclicals at a time like this. How would you be going about it?\\nIt is very challenging to manage large money which is shifting from one side to another. But we do whatever we can do with our understanding of things but one cannot sit not taking notice of the opportunities here.\\n\\nInfra is a pocket that you are still confident on given the fact that we are seeing a spending push on that front. Steel aside, will cement, infra and even real estate to some extent will continue to thrive?\\nSitting here, it looks like things are grim on the ground level, but other markets like China and the US are dollar priced. All the commodities are dollar priced and if there is a boom in China and in the US, obviously it will boom here also. That is happening and the difficult part is to fathom what it is. Is it a super cycle? Is it a temporary blip? It has gone up vertically and it can fall vertically. So, there are danger in commodities if there is a demand collapse in any part of the world. Right now. it is taken for granted that demand will surge. Till global monetary systems start tightening, we have at least one year upmove. The current trend is likely to strengthen and there is an opportunity.\\n\\nHow are you looking at capitalising on the new tech as well as strong digitisation play across the spectrum? Will it be via unlisted players? Are you looking at traditional IT plays or fintech players?\\nDigitisation is here to stay and is going to become a more important part of life. Twenty years ago, there was hardly any internet and today without internet, we cannot do anything. This is how the technology keeps becoming more and more important. Earlier tech used to be only a support function. Today if you do not have tech, howsoever good you are in your profession, I do not think you are going to make it.\\n\\nOne has to look for businesses suited for online kind of fulfilment. The capacity of financial system can be literally unlimited. If you are selling some physical goods, your capacity is limited to whatever is available. If you are selling cement, even by online you can only sell as much as you can produce. But in the case of financial services, the capacity is literally unlimited. As the volume goes up, the cost per unit goes down. The possibilities of digital economy is quite staggering and we have just about started.\\n\\nAs the digital companies in India gets listed, we are definitely going to see many companies coming in which are pure digital, 50% digital or 70% digital. The biggest thing is that people like us, who are not children of digital economy, have to improve our understanding of this particular way of thinking because digital economy, digital companies are not built for EPS and PE. They have a very different way of building businesses. Eventually they make money, there is a lot of free cash flow and that is what you value. But to start with, it could be very different and by the time you realise it is a good business, valuations get crazy. It will be difficult but we will try to learn the game and let us see whether we can really come on top of it.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRaamdeo AgrawalCyclical ThemeCommoditiesEt NowStock MarketTata SteelBajaj AutoNMDCMotilal Oswal Financial Services\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

The polls started on March 27 and concluded on April 29.\\n\\nSingh has claimed that there is an \"indirect discrimination\" against the general public as fines are collected from them for violating COVID-19 norms, but no action is taken against politicians.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCovidElection CommissionDelhi High CourtMHAPandemicMinistry Of Home AffairsSecond Wave\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nM.L.GUPTA\\n119 days ago\\nThe Home Ministry and the M/o H&FW etc. should take action against producers/sellers of \"CORONA DAVAI\".

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place.\\nGetty Images\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\nRELATED\\nFinancial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India\\n3 approaches to equity investing\\nAuto, insurance good for investment in medium to long term: Kunj Bansal\\nBy Erin Lowry\\n\\nLook around and you’d see a digital-era gold rush. There’s hype about cryptocurrencies, NFTs and GameStop-gate, not to mention the continued rise of the stock market, which many are watching through their Robinhood apps. Although some people will amass wealth through these assets, there is another form of investing that’s piqued my interest as of late.\\n\\nIn researching different ways to build wealth, I was struck by the opportunities VC and angel investors have for not only generating returns but also shaping the future.\\n\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place. They can fund ventures with innovative ideas that other investors might not see and back companies created by underrepresented founders in the startup world.\\n\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\n\\nOne issue, however, is access. As is often the case in wealth building, it takes money to make money. Angel investors are generally required to be “accredited investors.” For decades, the threshold for being accredited in the U.S. meant you needed either a net worth of $1 million, excluding a primary residence, or an individual income of at least $200,000 in each of the two most recent years ($300,000 for those filing jointly). In December 2020, the SEC expanded the definition to allow “natural persons to qualify as accredited investors based on certain professional certifications, designations or credentials or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution, which the Commission may designate from time to time by order.”\\n\\nHowever, there is a discussion about whether the net worth and income requirements are too low for today’s climate. One angel told me she felt these were too low for those in expensive cities because one would need to invest more to be adequately diversified. She’d prefer to see $5 million as the net worth minimum.\\n\\nHere’s the rationale. A 2017 survey found the median investment by an American angel was $25,000 per round to a single company. Now, let’s say you need to invest in at least 10 companies to be a diversified angel investor. That’d be a quarter-of-a-million dollars, which could mean 25% of someone’s net worth. Considering the volatility of the investments, even when properly diversified, that’s entirely too much risk. The prevailing rule of thumb is to not have more than 5% of your portfolio in speculative investments.\\n\\nBut although it makes sense to ensure investors are property diversified, this cap is incredibly restrictive. Demanding a $5 million or even $1 million net worth effectively blocks people from what can be impactful wealth building opportunities.\\n\\nFortunately, things are changing. Much like fractional shares changed the ability to invest in stocks, technology is opening up more opportunities for individuals to take advantage of angel investing. Enter equity crowdfunding.\\n\\nPlenty of millennials are familiar with crowdfunding via platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, where people ask for money to start a business or help with unexpected expenses, and funders donate without expecting any ownership in the project or repayment. Equity crowdfunding operates along a similar principle in that you pool your money with anonymous strangers on the Internet, but in this case it’s to fund a company.\\n\\nThe big difference is, you get an interest in the business. It’s akin to contributing to an index fund or fractional shares. You own a small slice of equity, depending on how much you invest.\\n\\nEquity crowdfunding comes in two common forms: accredited, which is defined the same way as above, and open-access regulated, which is open to anyone who can legally invest. Sites like Republic and WeFunder offer the regular, non-accredited investor (like me) a chance to give angel investing a try. The type of security can vary based on the startup. For example, Republic offers Crowd SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), Token Purchase Agreements for Blockchain-related projects and Crowd Simple Debt Agreements.\\n\\nWhen considering how much to invest, it’s critical to remember that this should only be a speculative part of anyone’s portfolio. Settle on an amount of money you’re comfortable losing to the cause of funding a company you believe should exist and to — let’s be honest — the hope of making some money as well.\\n\\nDon’t forget that you’re just as likely to lose significant money or see your stake diluted overtime. Stats on startup failures run the gamut, but an oft-quoted one is that 90% fail in the first three years. Even if you were to be optimistic and say 50% — that’s still good odds you’d lose your money.\\n\\nI think attempts to democratize angel investing through equity crowdfunding are worthwhile because they point to a world where it’s not only the wealthy determining which startups live or die based on who gets funding. This doesn’t mean early-stage investing is the right route for everyone or that it will yield more than dashed dreams of funding the next Google or Facebook or Uber. But it’s a compelling option if you want to put (a small percentage of) your money to work.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAngel InvestingSecAngel InvestorsStock MarketGoogleCommissionGofundmeRobinhood\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Having a manager whose leadership style puts a strain on their daily life can be a challenge – especially in uncertain times such as this. Many of us have come across various types of dysfunctional bosses- the passive aggressive one who makes those unnecessary sarcastic comments and remarks in meetings of your work, the micro-manager who wants to haunt you at every step of the project and changes/corrects every step. The abusive/aggressive one, who screams loudly to express their thoughts about everything you do. Or the stalker manager who checks on your every move at work – even when you take that much needed coffee break. Here’s how you can deal with a demanding boss, and keep your job.\\n\\n- Calm your body to calm yourself. Your body is always a good place to start to acknowledge and build awareness of defences that might be up. Focus on your body and what’s happening within. It might be helpful to take 5 mindful breathes to be able to focus on what is inside and what is outside. Neuroscience tells us that embodied practice is where real and sustainable behavioural change occurs.\\n\\n- Make sure you have identified the difference between being a boss and being bossy. This means exercising authority is not the same as being overly authoritative. Someone needs to be the one in-charge, the one to make decisions, and to make sure work is done in a timely fashion. A good boss will see when their team needs direction and will provide it in a constructive way. A bossy boss will try to control the situation by demanding certain things to be done without taking into consideration the capacity of the employee.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\n- When struggling with unrealistic deadlines or expectations it is essential to bring your expertise, gauge the scenario and not dwell into insecurity that you can’t do it. And yet if it still feels unrealistic, review it regarding how much time and effort it would actually take from your experience and then find ways to communicate that. Try chunking a big project into small tasks so as to not get overwhelmed by the deadlines placed on you.\\n\\n- Evaluate your boss’s approach and style to understand if you’ll get a better response by behaving proactively or reactively. The way boss’s work could also be a management culture. Embodying the boss’s style helps to know what to expect and how to respond to it. You'll gain valuable insights into some of the ways you may be holding yourself back from being able to make greater contributions.\\n\\n-Build empathy. It would be very difficult to be empathetic in situations that feel like a dead-end. Try to understand what is leading your boss to be this way. It will definitely help you to see and understand things from their perspective. What is the boss’s outlook? What might he/she be dealing with in their role? What challenges do they have to face?\\n\\n- Feasible and realistic solutions tend to catch more attention and acknowledgements. Be receptive to the feedback that you receive but do not accept all the feedback. If you disagree, you can communicate authentically without being aggressive or disrespectful. Approach your boss in a calm, professional, and rational manner. Asking for feedback doesn’t necessarily mean it will be positive. So be open to the idea of critical feedback. Your success also depends on the delivery and timing of your discussion; make sure you listen and are mindful of how you respond.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDemanding BossCalmBossNeuroscienceMental HealthWork StressWork From Home\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",

Those below 18 years would be most vulnerable,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After each wave flattens, we have seen a resurgence in other countries too. It’ll take 90-120 days after the wave flattens for the virus resurgence,” said Dr CN Manjunath, head, Covid-19 expert committee and nodal officer for Covid testing in the state.\\n\\nCovid live updates\\n\\nKarnataka’s experience, and that of European countries, shows that the third wave will be definitely there and preparation to tackle it must be taken seriously, say experts. Covid-appropriate behaviour like mask usage, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowds and hand hygiene, apart from vaccination, must be given utmost priority, they say.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Dr Manjunath, all precautionary measures, restrictions on gatherings, religious events, political rallies, local body elections and fairs must be continued till December 2021. “The severity will be more in unvaccinated persons. The need is to speed up vaccination,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe agreed with Dr Sudarshan that children would be more vulnerable. “There are trials of Pfizer vaccines on children. By then, we may get vaccines for children too,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to Dr KR Bharath Kumar Reddy, paediatric pulmonologist and director, Shishuka Children’s Specialty Hospital, children would be vulnerable because of lack of vaccination. “However, the virus transmission chain may break as adults at home would be vaccinated and they may not spread to kids. Currently, in most cases, adults are transmitting to children who are not going to schools,” Dr Reddy said.\\n\\nUnless those in the 18-44 years category are vaccinated by October, a high number of cases will be seen among them too, experts said.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nResurgenceCovidChildrenKarnatakaTechnical Advisory CommitteeTACThird WaveVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n6 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nvaradharajan balasubramanian\\n119 days ago\\nyoung people should know this virus can adopt itself to changing situations.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations.\\nGetty Images\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years.\\nRELATED\\nPhysical gold in India swings to discount as pandemic stalls demand\\nView: Inflation-tolerant Fed will boost commodity prices\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nCOMMODITY SUMMARY\\nMCX\\nCOPPER\\nBy Eddie Spence and Megan Durisin\\n\\nThe prices of raw materials used to make almost everything are skyrocketing, and the upward trajectory looks set to continue as the world economy roars back to life.\\n\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years. The rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations. With the U.S. economy pumped up on fiscal stimulus, and Europe’s economy starting to reopen as its vaccination rollout gets into gear, there’s little reason to expect a change in direction.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. said this week it sees a continued rally in commodities and that the “reflation and reopening trade will continue.” On top of that, the Federal Reserve and other central banks seem calm about inflation, meaning economies could be left to run hot, which will rev up demand even more.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\n“The most important drivers supporting commodity prices are the global economic recovery and acceleration in the reopening phase,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. The bank expects commodities as a whole to rise about 10% in the next year.\\n\\nChina, a crucial source of supply and demand for raw materials, is playing a big role, particularly as the government tries to reduce production of key metals like steel and aluminum. It’s also buying up massive amounts of grains. Food prices are also being affected as poor weather in key growing nations like Brazil and France hits harvests.\\n\\nAs just about every basic material gets rapidly more expensive, here’s some ways the rally is rippling across the globe to create winners and losers.\\n\\nGoing Green\\nCopper has enjoyed an unstoppable rally for more than a year thanks to pledges by governments to boost renewable energy and electric vehicle use. That’ll make all the various forms of green technology that rely on it a bit more expensive.\\n\\nBigger power grids is one such case. About 1.9 million tons of copper was used to build electricity networks in 2020, according to BloombergNEF, and the price of the red metal is up more than 90% in the past year. Usage will almost double by 2050, BNEF forecasts, while demand from other low carbon technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels will also balloon.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBuyers and Sellers\\nFor countries, the impact of the commodity rally depends on whether they’re an exporter or importer. For those relying heavily on exporting raw materials, the huge upswings can only be good news for public finances, especially when they’ve just been stricken by a once-in-a-century pandemic. The likes of Australia (iron ore), Chile (copper) and Indonesia (palm oil) all make huge sums from commodities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, countries looking to rebuild infrastructure may find their budgets buy less than they used to. President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion plan is one such case. Electricity grids, railways and refurbishing buildings are among the items on the shopping list that will use large amounts of metal.\\n\\nConsultancy CRU Group estimates the program will add 5 million tons of steel to the 80 million the U.S. uses each year, with similar boosts to aluminum and copper demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nMeat\\nIt’s been a tough year to be in the meat business, from devastating Covid outbreaks to the deadly pig disease that hit Germany and is roaring back in China.\\n\\nAnd as crop prices surge, farmers rearing poultry, pigs and cattle are among the first to get squeezed by the eye-watering run-up in grains. Costs for corn fed to livestock have doubled in the past year, and soybean meal is more than 40% higher. While there’s a delay before that hits the burger chain or steakhouse, there are already signs of prices creeping higher.\\n\\nOld Steel Mills\\nSteel producers in Europe and America have suffered for years from low prices caused by global overcapacity. Plants struggled to make money and job security became a growing worry. Over 85,000 steel jobs were lost in the European Union between 2008 and 2019, according to industry association Eurofer.\\n\\nThat’s all changed dramatically thanks to booming steel prices. Futures in China, by far the biggest producer, have smashed records — even outpacing gains in key ingredient iron ore — as the government took measures to curb output. That’s supercharged rallies of benchmark prices in Europe and America, where mills were already running at maximum capacity as they try to meet unexpectedly high demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBreakfast Tables\\nWhether you prefer latte or espresso, sweetened or plain, the key ingredients of a cup of coffee have surged. Arabica coffee futures have risen about 33% in the past year, while raw sugar has also advanced. Fancy a slice of toast? Benchmark wheat prices have hit the highest since 2013.\\n\\nOf course, rising commodities don’t immediately show up on grocery shelves and cafe menus. They make up just a part of the costs for retailers, which often absorb the initial increase to keep customers coming back. But there’s a limit to that margin hit, and high prices could ultimately feed through to consumers.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSteelLumberCornUBS Group AGEuropean UnionCopperCommoditiesFederal Reserve\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Shares of the video game retailer and many other meme stocks that rallied in its wake are well off their highs, and retail trading has dropped from levels seen earlier in the year.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing some return of interest to those Reddit-type stocks but not with the same pace and fervor we saw before,\" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management.\\n\\nStill, some market-watchers believe a smaller-scale face-off between retail investors and short sellers may have sparked part of the volatility in MicroVision and other recent movers.\\n\\nAverage short interest in a basket of 50 stocks with market capitalization of under $100 billion monitored by Vanda Research has climbed to levels last seen in January, the firm said in a report earlier this week.\\n\\nAt the same time, cash equity purchases and the premium spent on call options for MicroVision and some of the other gainers soared in recent weeks, an indicator of retail buying, according to analysts at Vanda, which tracks retail activity.\\n\\n\"With the precedent of Melvin Capital in mind, we suspect that the long/short community started to trim bearish bets as soon as they sniffed a potential comeback from the Reddit crowd,\" Vanda’s analysts wrote.\\n\\nMicroVision, which traded below $1 as recently as June 2020, is up 210% since short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the company’s stock on Dec. 22, illustrating the potential dangers bearish investors face when positioning against meme stocks. Hindenburg Research did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\n“Right now you can have a perfectly logical reason to short a stock and still take a terrible beating if a group of small traders pull together to push the stock in the other direction,\" said Phipps.\\n\\nWATCHING WSB\\nCarson Block, founder of short seller Muddy Waters Research, said he keeps a keen eye on online chatter and forums such as WallStreetBets, where users often attempt to coordinate their buying in stocks they believe are short-squeeze candidates.\\n\\n“We are now watching closely,” said Block.\\n\\nBlock said he is now more focused on technical aspects such as companies where a high percentage of stock is owned by insiders and institutional investors that are unlikely to sell the shares.\\n\\nWhether the stars will align anytime soon for another move on the scale of GameStop\\'s remains to be seen. That stock had a combination of short interest that peaked at about 145% of the float, according to S3 Partners data, a massive following among retail investors and institutions happy to jump in on the shares\\' wild ride.\\n\\nInvestors are “looking for history possibly to repeat or looking for stocks that are going to go parabolic,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. However, “GameStop was such an outlier in price moves that (it) is difficult for that to happen again.”\\n\\nThere are signs, however, that broader trading activity among retail investors may be picking up.\\n\\nIn the latest week, there was $700 million in net retail buying of large-cap companies tracked by JPMorgan, compared with $500 million in the previous period, the bank said in a report issued on Wednesday.\\n\\nVanda Research said purchases of single stocks by retail investors have ticked higher, though they remain much lower than in previous months. Meanwhile, buying of exchange-traded funds by retail investors fell earlier in the week to its lowest levels since late last year, a potential sign they may be ready to take on more risk, the firm said.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nMeme StocksS3 PartnersJPMorganWallstreet BetsVideo Game Retailer Gamestop CorpPhippsMelvin CapitalGameStop CorpStocks\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Household size was an important explanatory factor for the disparity for COVID-19 mortality in South Asian groups only.\\n\\nDr Mathur said: \"While multigenerational living may increase risk of exposure and transmission (from children or working age adults to older or vulnerable family members), such households and extended communities also offer valuable informal care networks and facilitate engagement with health and community services.\\n\\n\"In light of emerging evidence that minority ethnic groups are less likely to take up the COVID-19 vaccine, co-designing culturally competent and non-stigmatising engagement strategies with these communities is increasingly important.\"\\n\\nOn behalf of NHS England, the research team used the new secure OpenSAFELY data analytics platform to analyse partially anonymised electronic health data collected by general practitioners (GPs) covering 40 per cent of England.\\n\\nThese GP records were linked to other national coronavirus-related data sets for the first and second waves of the pandemic - including testing, hospital data and mortality records. Ethnicity was self-reported by participants in GP records and grouped into five census categories (white, South Asian, Black, other, mixed) and then a further 16 sub-groups.\\n\\n\"Minority ethnic groups in the UK are disproportionately affected by factors that also increase the risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, such as living in deprived areas, working in front-line jobs, and having poorer access to healthcare,\" notes Dr Mathur.\\n\\n\"Our study indicates that even after accounting for many of these factors, the risk for testing positive, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death was still higher in minority ethnic groups compared with white people in England.\\n\\n\"To improve COVID-19 outcomes, we urgently need to tackle the wider disadvantage and structural racism faced by these communities, as well as improving access to care and reducing transmission,\" she said.\\n\\nThe authors caution that there are some limitations to the study including an inability to capture all potential explanatory variables, including occupation, health-related behaviours, and experiences of racism or structural discrimination.\\n\\nThey call for improving the completeness of ethnicity recording in health data to further support the conduct of high-quality research into addressing health inequalities for COVID-19 and beyond.\\n\\nThe study, believed to be the largest of its type, was funded by the UK\\'s Medical Research Council and conducted by scientists from a group of universities including LSHTM and the University of Oxford, along with the National Institute of Health Research.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nTesting PositiveCovidNHS EnglandLondon School Of Hygiene & Tropical MedicineCoronavirusMinority Ethnic GroupsLancetUniversity Of Oxford\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nBank of Baroda, RBL and IDFC First could double from here: Sanjiv Bhasin\\nGame not over in pharma, chemicals: Pashupati Advani\\nIf you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now, says Naveen Kulkarni, CIO, Axis Securities Ltd.\\n\\n2020 was all about Reliance and those big deals that we saw for Jio and retail. What will be the next picture for RIL NSE -0.14 %? That’s what the markets would want to know.\\nIf you look at Reliance Industries, the stock did pretty well till October or so. November onwards, the stock started cooling off and from highs closer to Rs 2,300, the stock has been hovering between Rs 1,800-2,200. The stock has corrected and there has been some bit of derating also that has happened.\\n\\nBut having said that, the critical aspect is how the overall industry cycle is going to pan out. If the O2C segment starts doing better, then I think there is a play because the stock has been an underperformer for the last four to five months. The important aspect that we need to see is how sustainable these trends are going to be. The current quarter numbers look quite encouraging. If the trend continues to be an upcycle, there is much scope for the stock to do well just based on the operating performance.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Reliance Industries Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAs far as other triggers are concerned, the Aramco deal is pretty much one aspect that we could be looking at. Apart from that, if the retail business or digital services business gets listed on foreign bourses, those could be the trigger. It could be the long-term trigger but from an operating performance perspective, the O2C segment is going to be very critical. We already know how the Jio platform business is panning out. The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place. Other businesses are where they see more value to be created, especially the O2C segment.\\n\\nWould it make sense for Reliance shareholders to hold a stake in Aramco and give up stake in O2C? Will the deal be as attractive as a plain cash for stake deal?\\nIt is difficult to make a case for that at this point in time. It remains to be seen how a pure share swap deal will enthuse the investors. Cash has also its own advantages as well as disadvantages. But we will have to wait and watch out what exactly is on offer. Also, an important factor will be what it could mean in terms of controlling stake and how the company is going to be run. Those will be the critical aspects that one will have to watch out for. It is difficult to gauge the benefits at this point in time. But it might be a very interesting thing to look at. We have not had something like this in India as far as I can remember. So that will be something that we all will be looking forward to.\\n\\nWould we see Reliance Industries’ three main businesses being hived off into three different divisions? Is that something all of you in the markets and the analysts community are still following up?\\nMore important aspect will be how the holding structure will pan out once the business is structured. There are a lot of moving parts here. One is to look at that sum of the parts and say that the value of the sum of the parts is probably higher than what the market is ascribing to in terms of numbers. But the important aspect would be how the structuring will actually happen and more importantly, how the businesses will be run after that.\\n\\nIt is like two to three steps ahead of what we are able to analyse at this point in time in terms of the sum of parts valuation. So it remains to be seen. If you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now. But the challenge has been that it is difficult to envisage how the structure of the company will evolve post that and that is why the market is ascribing the value to what the sum of the parts valuation entails. So we will have to wait and watch out how that happens, but as far as the analyst community is concerned, the sum of the parts valuation for these three businesses are very much considered and that is the way that company is being valued now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSegment PicksJioReliance IndustriesAramcoRilNaveen KulkarniRill O2C Business\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

As many as 15,523 people have died since the outbreak of the pandemic last year.\\n\\nCiting Maharashtra where a 44-day lockdown brought the infection under control to a good extent, Sudhakar appealed to the people to follow the regulations instead of loitering around unnecessarily.\\n\\nTo a question on the vaccination drive for people above 18 years of age, which could not take off fully from May 1 as was announced by the Central government, he said adequate stock of vaccine did not arrive due to which the drive was started symbolically by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa with the available stock of three lakh vaccines.\\n\\n\"We have a stock of vaccines, which is not huge to meet the requirement. We will inform people once the vaccines arrive in the State,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Health Minister said the State government has set a target to vaccinate everyone.\\n\\nTo a question on shortage of drugs and oxygen, he said there is unnecessary panic among people who are hoarding Remdesivir vials and oxygen fearing that they would not get in case of an emergency. According to him, at least 85 per cent of the infected people remain asymptomatic whereas only five to eight per cent show moderate symptoms.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDr K SudhakarKarnatakaLockdownHealth Minister\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " \"Synopsis\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports.\\nGetty Images\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level.\\nRELATED\\nSelloff shows market to remain shackled by Covid fears for now\\nDIIs emerge smart buyers as bulls & bears play tug of war\\nForeign investors bet on economy rebound as they look beyond India's Covid-19 crisis\\nNifty’s trading range remained wider than usual during the week gone by, but it took a serious cut on Friday’s session. Despite that, the index managed to close the week on a positive note. In the previous weekly note, we had mentioned that Nifty was trading inside the Falling Channel that it had created, and any decisive move above the 15,000 mark would offer cues about the market’s upward move.\\n\\nHowever, the index has failed to move past that point and stayed inside the channel. Following a rangebound week, the headline index finally ended with a net gain of 289 points (+2.02%) on a weekly basis.\\n\\nIn the week before this one, Nifty had violated an important pattern support that comes in the form of a Rising Trend Line drawn from the lows of March 2020. Despite the violation of this pattern support, Nifty averted weakness this time by managing to hang around precariously near this trend line.\\n\\nVolatility has risen and INDIA VIX has grown marginally by 1.49% to 23.0300 level. For the coming week and beyond, it would be crucially important for the 50-pack to stay above this trend line, and any failure to do so will increase the possibility of violation of the Falling Channel that the Nifty is in. This can also invite incremental weakness in the market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports. In the event of any corrective move, this trading range is likely to widen. The weekly RSI stands at 58.86; it stays neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD remains bearish and stays below the Signal Line.\\n\\nA Shooting Star formation has emerged on the candles. Such a formation would occur when the price shows a gapup start, trends higher, but closes much lower being unable to sustain the gains.\\n\\nSince such a candle has emerged near a pattern resistance level, it can have bearish implications. However, as always, this would require confirmation on the next bar. Pattern analysis showed Nifty is inside a channel that it has formed; and it has not been able to break out of this channel and is clinging on to an important pattern support of a trend line that begins from March 2020 lows and joins the subsequent higher bottoms.\\n\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level. While the market is in seeing such a retracement, the out-of-control Covid situation in the country is hitting investor sentiment hard. There is a clear shift in preference towards the traditionally defensive stocks.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nWe recommend staying highly stock-specific and keeping fresh purchases limited to low-beta and defensive stocks. All rallies should be used more for taking some money off the table rather than making fresh purchases. While keeping the overall exposures at a modest level, a highly cautious outlook is advised for the coming week.\\n\\nIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectoral indices against CNX500 (Nifty500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free-float market-cap of all the listed stocks.\\n\\nTJE review of RRG showed only Metal, Midcap100 and the Commodity Indices are showing steady relative momentum while being placed inside the leading quadrant. Energy, Infrastructure and PSE Indices are inside the leading quadrant, but they all appear to be losing their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty PSU Bank, Realty and Nifty Bank Indices are all inside the weakening quadrant. All of them appear to be rotating south-west and giving up their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to relatively underperform the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Financial Services index has rolled inside the lagging quadrant, while the Auto Index is languishing inside this quadrant. Nifty IT and Media indices are also inside this quadrant, but they were seen improving their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Consumption Index has just rolled inside the improving quadrant. It joins Nifty Pharma and FMCG indices, which are also inside the improving quadrant. They appear to be steadily maintaining their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to show a resilient performance and relatively outperform the broader market.\\n\\nImportant Note: RRGTM charts show the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. In the above chart, they show relative performance against the Nifty500 Index (broader market) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.\\n\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA is a Consultant Technical Analyst and founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, Vadodara.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\nAgencies\\nRepresentative Image\\nIndia is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic. On April 25, 2021, we reported over 3.5 lakh cases of fresh infections from the coronavirus. This was the highest ever single day account since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from the steep surge in the rate of infections, another pressing concern is the rising fatality rate. Onwards April 19, 2021, we have been losing over 2000 lives daily to the virus.\\n\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\n\\nIndia’s Vaccination Plan\\nThe first phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, 2021. It aimed to inoculate 30 crores of people by July 2021 with a target of 70 lakh doses administered daily. In line with WHO’s recommendations, the beneficiaries of the first phase were healthcare and frontline workers. Subsequently, the second phase of the inoculation drive saw the net being widened. People over the age of 60, or people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, were eligible beneficiaries. On April 1, 2021, the second phase was extended to people of 45 years and above. The third phase of the vaccination would be set in motion from May 1, 2021. It will provide access to vaccines for people in the age group of 18-45 years of age.\\n\\nThe National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration opted for the distribution of the vaccines as per age groups. This made sense as the fatalities recorded in people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities were significantly higher. However, the slow rate of vaccination at 8.7 % of the total population in 90 days compared to 36.3 % in the US and 32.3 % in the UK is proving to be counter-intuitive of this theory. The sluggishness is partly due to the initial vaccine hesitancy followed soon after by huge vaccine shortage. May be this was one reason for PM Modi to exhort the nation into celebration of 'Tika Utsav' vaccination festival from April 11 to April 14. However, the doses administered during the Tika Utsav fell due to supply constraints.\\n\\nVaccine shortage\\nBetween April 1 and April 2021, on an average 36 lakh doses were administered across the country. But, during the Tika Utsav, on an average only 32 lakh doses were administered. As many as 900 inoculation centres (65 %) were closed all over Odisha because of unavailability of vaccines. Odisha was only provided one-tenth of its demand for 25 lakh vaccines for 10 days for the Tika Utsav, despite the state achieving negative vaccine wastage. Average vaccinations have shrunk from 32 lakhs during the Tika Utsav to just about 25 lakhs between April 15 and April 26. Whereas a record low of 9 lakh vaccinations took place on April 25, the day the country recorded its highest ever daily cases of fresh infections.\\n\\nThis problem is likely to get accentuated in phase 3 of the vaccination process due to acute shortage in manufacture and supply of vaccines. Odisha, for example, does not expect its vaccination to start before May 15 for Covaxin and end of May for Covishield.\\n\\nUnlike other countries which boldly stockpiled corona virus vaccines even when they were undergoing clinical trials, India probably played inexplicably safe. We continued to put ad hoc orders and did not strengthen the production line of Bharat Biotech (BB) (producer of Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (SII) (producer of Covishield) until recently. Maybe we assumed that there would not be a second wave.\\n\\nBurden on the States\\nAdded to the above, the higher price of both the vaccines for states has put them under enormous fiscal burden. In the third phase, beginning May 1, cumulatively about 60 crores of population (aged between 18-45 years) would be eligible for vaccination in various states whereas the national age-wise distribution of population over the age of 45 accounts for only about 34 crores. This implies that there is a disproportionate fiscal pressure on the states most of whom have understandably already declared universal free vaccinations. This is further aggravated manifold by a higher pricing (Rs.400-Rs.600) of both the vaccine types for the states compared to the Centre (Rs.150 per dose) even while all earlier universal immunization efforts in India have been Central schemes with a pre-determined sharing pattern between Centre and states to keep the implementation simple.\\n\\nThe states could have harnessed this money towards strengthening the already noticeable inadequate infrastructure in the district and sub-district hospitals, preparing for a possible third wave. Additionally, the higher price of Covaxin and Covishield for private hospitals would crowd out the private sector and their infrastructure and manpower from this national effort as people would throng government centres for free shots, thus putting enormous pressure on the existing fragile government–run vaccination centres.\\n\\nWay Forward\\nVaccinate and vaccinate fast. This is the best-fit solution. Along with Covid appropriate behaviour, an expedited vaccination drive is the need of the hour to break the chain of transmission. Currently, we have only vaccinated about 10 persons per capita while Brazil and China have vaccinated 18 and 16 persons per capita. At present, the centre should enforce immediate compulsory licensing under Patent Act for both the manufacturers while simultaneously approving a greater number of manufactures and vaccine types to preclude possibilities of cartelisation and profiteering. This would allow other manufacturers without infringing on intellectual property. Additionally, India should continue to advocate for relaxation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) given the global health emergency to quickly ramp up production of vaccines.\\n\\n(The author is Member of Rajya Sabha of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) from Odisha.

       " \"Synopsis\\n‘The year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses’\\nETMarkets.com\\nGoing forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nRIL stock may rally if O2C segment picks up: Naveen Kulkarni\\nPharma, chemicals, speciality chemicals game not over; look at infra too: Pashupati Advani\\nThe margin trends of consumer companies will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities.\\n\\nWhat is the stance that you will be taking on banks going forward? Is it the lending services where one needs to have a larger exposure or should one focus on corporate-facing banks or retail-oriented ones? Where should one actually hold positions?\\nThe results of most of the banks were slightly disappointing to begin with. I was quite surprised when most of these banks started going up this week. They had indeed moderated over the last one day but overall, the week has been good for the banks. The results were quite bad for most of the banks because if you look at the NPA trend and really focus on the quality of the earnings that have been reported, the proforma invoices are pretty large for most of the banks. You can clearly make out the distinction between two sets of banks; banks that have made good amounts of provisions versus banks that have not made good amounts of provisions. They are also struggling with their capitalisation ratio, i.e., the tier one capitalisation.\\n\\nIf you distinguish these parameters, you will notice that the year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses to be borne with as we go forward.\\n\\nAs it is, we have now this vicious second wave of Covid coming in and that is going to create a whole lot of problems for the banking sector. Going forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors and if you ask me frankly, the markets are going to get a little jittery as we close out the May month.\\n\\nHow are you looking at some of the consumption companies that have come out with their earnings? Given the kind of commentary they have given in terms of the volume growth and given the current environment, what is it that you are expecting in terms of trends from consumers?\\nConsumer companies have reported good earnings and most of them actually have reported margins against the fear that commodity costs were going up. The margin trends have been quite good. Volume growth, of course, has been in double digits and that is what was expected from most of the consumer companies. We also know that the logistics are unaffected due to government’s lockdown measures.\\n\\nGiven this situation, for most of the consumer companies who are dependent on logistics companies, there is a lot of e-commerce kind of distribution happening. There are also a lot of digitisation moves that we are seeing. We will encourage most of the FMCG companies to maintain their growth trends ahead.\\n\\nHowever, I still believe that the margin trends will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost push that we had seen come into their earnings in the first quarter. So again, going forward it will be a little bit negative for FMCG companies. The margin trends will be weaker. But the only good point that we should acknowledge here is most of them should be looking at better volume growth as we move ahead.\\n\\nWhat is your outlook on the entire infrastructure/capital goods space? What is it that you are factoring in by way of the execution of the ordering trends in light of the second wave?\\nMost of the infrastructure project activities are subdued as you have labour shortages. You even have material shortages coming in certain places and order intake has been quite weak. Most of the orders that you are seeing are driven by government orders, which are pending for several months and therefore being expedited now. There is no fresh capex intent that we are seeing in a big manner and therefore, the overall capital goods and infrastructure space is going to be a little weaker.\\n\\nAlso, remember that the inflation is perking up a little bit and we sense that somewhere, the RBI will have to step in either with the rate increase or an outlook that tries to tighten the overall money supply situation so that inflation is in a way reined in. Any rise in inflation and thereby rise in interest rates does not augur really well for most of the infrastructure companies or most of the capital goods companies. So the outlook remains quite weak for the capital goods companies.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCapital Goods StocksMargin TrendsRBIFmcgInfrastructure StocksGood EarningsConsumer CompaniesNPAMahantesh Sabarad\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

       " 'Synopsis\\nThis time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up.\\niStock\\nSkinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over.\\nRELATED\\nHow e-commerce has changed shopping rules in the pandemic\\nThese robots are helping residents of Singapore with grocery shopping\\nCovid19 second wave-led local restrictions, curfews halve malls, shopping centres’ revenue\\nWomen are saying yes to the dress. The garment has become one emblem of the post-lockdown consumer, as economies slowly reopen in places like the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nAnd dressier clothing is just the start of what may be a “great rotation” in consumer spending. At the end of last year, we argued that a vaccine-driven economic recovery would shift what people buy — they’d order less leisure wear and buy fewer cushions, but put more money toward champagne, suits and experiences. In categories like fashion and cosmetics, this shift is indeed happening; however, other areas like dining, travel and big events have yet to really get going.\\n\\nUntil trips to offices and sunny climes pick up again, retailers and manufacturers will have to manage this sputtering recovery and deal with levels of demand that may be much more, or much less, than they expected.\\n\\nUrban Outfitters Inc. was the first to signal the return to dressing up. It said that at its Anthropologie brand in the last week of February, seven of its 10 best-selling online items were dresses. Over the previous year, one or two dresses at most would have made the top 10.\\n\\nWhen British retail reopened in June and December 2020, shoppers bought many of the same things they were ordering in lockdown — lots of leisurewear and lingerie. This time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up, as are handbags and mascara (yes to above-the-mask makeup). There’s far less interest in comfortable clothes made for lounging at home.\\n\\n“Fashion is back,” declared Associated British Foods Plc, the owner of budget chain Primark. Clothing is undergoing its own metamorphosis: Skinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over. This is boosting denim sales, and should inspire sales of new tops and shoes to go with them.\\n\\nPutting on the Glitz\\nA return to office life will also fuel more fashion spending. Winser London, which specializes in stylish workwear for women, is seeing demand for more fitted dresses increase as cities open up again. Menswear hasn’t picked up as much, but sales should revive as employers call workers back to headquarters.\\n\\nSmarten Up\\nWhile the rotation in clothing appears well underway, the picture is more complicated in other consumer sectors. In food, for example, restaurants are getting busier, but people are still cooking and ordering a lot at home.\\n\\nNestle SA says it’s seeing demand recover for products used in restaurants, especially in China; at the same time, its Nespresso coffee unit is still benefiting from remote workers being their own baristas. Rekki, a technology platform that connects independent restaurants with food suppliers, has also seen orders rise as the hospitality sector comes back.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\nStarbucks Corp. is starting to see recovery in sales at U.S. shops in dense, urban areas — the type that rely on office workers and tourists. But growth in its home market in the latest quarter was still powered by suburban locations and drive-thru windows, a sign that pandemic routines haven’t yet faded.\\n\\nEat Up\\nThe home improvement category hasn’t changed much yet, but spending on renovations and other projects is expected to slow over time. Now that you’ve built a new shed and extended that loft, you probably won’t be repeating the process anytime soon. Some makeover projects envisioned in lockdown are still underway or awaiting an available contractor, but there will likely be fewer starting as vacations and sports tickets reclaim wallet share.\\n\\nHolidays typically take a large chunk of the family budget. Right now, there’s a lot of uncertainty over international travel and fewer tourists are booking vacations abroad in sunny destinations such as Greece and Spain. (No wonder demand for swimwear is lagging fashion.) But if travel to and around Europe does resume this summer, it will unleash a torrent of spending. Unilever Plc says the performance of its European ice-cream business would be linked to whether people can visit beaches and tourist towns.\\n\\nBeing in the midst of these shifts means retailers and consumer goods groups must keep planning for uncertainty and remain flexible. Strategies will have to take into account the vastly different Covid experiences across regions. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, clothing and food retailers should be ready to increase their supply. In markets still ravaged by the virus, such as India, the emphasis will be on meeting the needs of people who need to isolate, stay at home and recover from the virus.\\n\\nAs the great post-pandemic shift in consumer habits inches along, the old adage that “retail is detail” has never been more appropriate.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNestle SAPandemic ShoppingNespressoUnilever PlcPandemic FashionStarbucks Corp.\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRamesh Shah\\n119 days ago\\nIN INDIA ITS OUT OF SHEER FRUSTRATIONS..\\nVIEW COMMENTS ADD COMMENTS',\n",

In some states like Uttar Pradesh, the lockdowns have been limited to weekends while in others like Delhi and Maharashtra, they have been extended for weeks.\\n\\nIndustry executives fear the government may be forced to impose larger lockdowns given the ferocity with which the virus is spreading and claiming lives across the country. “If there is a larger lockdown, fuel demand will take a heavy hit,” said an oil company executive. “Lower domestic demand would also result in lower refinery runs.”\\n\\nFollowing a sharp recovery in oil demand last year, Indian refiners had started operating at full capacity. The capacity utilisation has again started falling though some refiners are trying to place some of their volumes in the export market.\\n( Originally published on May 01, 2021 )\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nBharat Petroleum Corp.Hindustan PetroleumIndian Oil CorpHindustan Petroleum CorpCoronavirus InfectionsBharat Petroleum\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n2 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRashika Khandelwal\\n119 days ago\\nThe graph attached above showing fuel demand growth has incorrect legends.

Everyone entering the counting venue will have to undergo Thermal Screening, wear Face Masks and Face Shields.\\n\\nThis time, due to Covid-19 protocol, the number of counting tables in each counting hall has been restricted to 7 Tables. This is to maintain social distance inside the Counting Hall. There is an increase of 34.71% in the number of Polling Stations over the number of Polling Stations in the 2016 Assembly Elections.\\n\\nIt is partly due to provision of 5325 numbers of Auxiliary Polling Stations set up in the current elections. Hence, there will be more EVM machines to be counted this time. Accordingly, counting rounds will also increase this time, due to several factors including large number of postal ballots received, counting of VVPAT slips and restricted number of counting tables despite considerable increase in the number of counting halls. Due to these factors, counting of votes will take more time compared to earlier elections. The number of rounds will be varying from minimum around 10 rounds to around 33 rounds for each LAC, depending onthe number of Polling Stations and Counting Tables.\\n\\nEveryone entering the Counting Halls will have to maintain Covid protocol. To maintain Covid protocol, numbers of counting halls have been increased by 131% i.e. from 143 in 2016 Assembly Election to 331 this time.\\n\\nThere will be one Micro Observer at each counting table, who reports directly to the Counting Observer appointed by ECI for every LAC.

       " 'Synopsis\\nRahul Gandhi accused the government of misreading and mishandling the situation and alleged that all early warning signs were ignored, including from scientists.\\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi\\nIn a wide-ranging exclusive interview with PTI, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday said the entire world is shaken by the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in India and there are queues everywhere, whether for oxygen cylinders, for life-saving medicines, for hospital beds and even outside crematoriums. He accused the government of misreading and mishandling the situation and alleged that all early warning signs were ignored, including from scientists. Here is the transcript of the interview:\\n\\nThe second wave of coronavirus has hit India hard. We see people gasping for medical aid, medicines, oxygen. They have no access to facilities in the national capital and across the country. How do you see the situation and the response of the government?\\nIt breaks my heart every single day to wake up to the absolute devastation around us. This is not a wave; it is a tsunami that has destroyed everything in its wake. There are never-ending queues everywhere. There are queues to get an oxygen cylinder, queues to refill the cylinder, queues to get life-saving medicines, queues to get a hospital bed, and now there are queues outside crematoriums. There is a fatal shortage of every single item we need to tackle COVID-19. Our capital\\'s best hospitals are bursting at the seams. We are getting frantic SOS calls for oxygen from India\\'s top doctors. Hospitals are petitioning High Courts for oxygen. Our healthcare workers are seeing patients die in front of their eyes, they cannot save people. India is now the world\\'s coronavirus epicentre. The entire world is shaken by what they are seeing in India. None of this should have happened. There were multiple early warning signs. Forget the signs, scientists clearly warned the government this would happen - they ignored them. We could and should have been much better prepared. And now, where is the government in this crisis? It is completely missing in action. They are obsessed only with saving the Prime Minister\\'s image and blaming others. The new buzzword is that the \\'system\\' has failed. Who is this \\'system\\'? Who runs the \\'system\\'? It\\'s just a ploy to avoid admitting responsibility.\\n\\nDid the government falter in assessing the Covid situation? Who is at fault?\\nAbsolutely. The Prime Minister is at fault. He runs a highly centralised and personalised government machinery, is solely and substantially devoted to building his own brand, is utterly focused on imagery rather than substance. The fact is that this Government completely failed to understand or to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic -- right from the very beginning, despite repeated warnings. Since the very start of this pandemic back in 2020, I kept trying to warn the government about the disaster ahead if we did not urgently prepare but they attacked me and ridiculed me. It\\'s not just me - anyone who tried to sound the alarm, the state callously and thoughtlessly ignored. Modi government let this virus enter India through our airports in February and March of 2020. And then it panicked and without consultation or thought imposed the world\\'s harshest lockdown. Migrant workers were left to fend for themselves and an unprecedented exodus began from the cities. The poorest of the poor were forced to walk hundreds of kilometres home with no support, no aid, no assistance. In his sheer ignorance, the Prime Minister said he would defeat the virus in 21 days, akin to the battle of Mahabharata! Modi government is plainly arrogant and focuses on perception over reality- declaring victory against the virus is absolute insanity and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the nature of what this virus is. The only way to fight corona is with humility and by realizing that you are faced with a relentless opponent, who can adapt and is very resilient. The PM had an entire year to better prepare, protect India, and think through this crisis but what did they do? Did the PM & the Govt add sufficient oxygen capacity, ramp up testing, increase hospital beds, ventilators? Did the PM think long-term about the state of our health infrastructure and start building for the sort of subsequent Corona waves that almost every country in the world was experiencing? It was sheer luck that we emerged out of last year\\'s nightmare, to a point where we had less than 10,000 new cases in a day early in 2021. We were not testing enough then. We are not testing enough now. Where was the preparation for this massive second wave? Why were the jumbo facilities put up last year dismantled? Why did they raise oxygen exports over 700% - think of that number, 700% - in the months before this brutal second wave?\\n\\nWhat could the Government have done differently to address the second wave?\\nThe Modi Government was both grossly negligent and blindly overconfident. The BJP announced the end of the pandemic and congratulated the Prime Minister for his \"success\" even as the second wave was just beginning. The Prime Minister himself is on record as having said that India had successfully fought the pandemic and won. In reality, there was no coherent strategy. One, the government should have built massive capacity over the last year -- testing, oxygen, hospital beds, ventilators. Two, they should not have declared victory prematurely. Three, the Prime Minister and his government did not even acknowledge there was a problem. How can you fix something you don\\'t even accept exists? Four, the government did not act on scientific advice or evidence. They continuously ignored rising cases and were busy instead with election campaigns. They encouraged super-spreader events. They even bragged about them. Our Prime Minister and Home Minister were not even wearing masks in public over the past few months. What sort of a message is that sending to citizens? Five, most importantly, the only solution we have is vaccination. We are supposed to be the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world. And yet, India is desperately short of vaccines. We are making them, why weren\\'t our people first in line to be vaccinated? If that is not a failure to plan and execute, what is?\\n\\nWith India seeing around 4 lakh cases a day, the highest in the world, is there a case for the national emergency considering the unprecedented crisis?\\nWe are already in the midst of a national emergency. But just declaring something is not the answer. The biggest problem of this government is it announces and then absconds. Now that the situation is completely out of control, they have dropped the ball and thrown it to the states. They have made the states and citizens truly \\'Aatmanirbhar\\'. Rely on yourself is the motto. No one will come to help you. Definitely, not the Prime Minister. The need of the hour is to hold hands, work together and heal our people. India must be the only country in the world facing this massive pandemic without the guidance of an expert and empowered group that is charged with fighting the virus and protecting the people, with planning ahead, anticipating needs and taking the decisions that will result in swift action to save lives.\\n\\nGoI has said it repeatedly warned states about the second wave and asked them to map the need for essential supplies like oxygen, ICU beds, and continue with containment efforts. Would you say the current situation is a collective failure of the Centre and states?\\nThe entire country has already been under the Epidemic Act for more than a year. The Centre has absolute power over states under the Act. This is a government that wants to control everything. When cases went down, they declared victory, and the Prime Minister took all the credit as he always does. Now that the situation is terrible, why are you blaming the states? Out of 162 oxygen plants sanctioned in October by the Centre, only 33 are functional. This was set up with the PM-CARES funds. The Modi Government took tens of thousands of crores of donations in his name, without any transparency, without any accountability. The states have rejected the sub-standard ventilators supplied by the Centre through these funds. States do not even get their GST dues on time. States are dependent on the Modi Government for quotas of oxygen, Remdesivir and Tocilizumab injections. The Modi Government has chained the hands of the states behind their backs, so they are completely powerless, and then asks them to sort out their own affairs. Obviously, the system will collapse.\\n\\nAdult vaccinations are starting on May 1 along the lines you demanded, but states say they cannot start as they do not have the vaccines. What is your view? Did you seek the expansion of vaccinations too early? The UK will start adult vaccines from June?\\nFirst, the government set a target of vaccinating 300 million by August. This is the above 45 age category. They managed to fully vaccinate not even 2 percent of the total population. With the mounting pressure of the government not vaccinating enough, they added another 600 million to the list, by starting vaccinations for the 18+ group from May 1. But where are the vaccines? Why did the Modi Government abandon the people between age groups of 18 to 44 years by refusing to take responsibility for their vaccination? Why is there a discriminatory policy on the pricing of vaccines? Why should there be five different prices for the same vaccine? What is the strategy beyond two companies? How can that suffice for almost 1 billion people? We need 2 billion doses. Now, they are scrambling for vaccines. The numbers just don\\'t add up.\\n\\nYou have said the liberalised Vaccine policy is discriminatory. Vaccine makers have reduced prices for states. Your comments?\\nThis is the story of \\'discount sale\\', where you mark up the price, and then make a show of reducing it. It is a complete eyewash. Why should states pay more than the Centre to buy vaccines? Why should the states be left to fend for themselves? Why should there be a difference in price for vaccines for the Centre, the States and the private hospitals? Why should the price of the vaccine even for the two companies be different? Why the discrepancy? After all, even when States pay for the vaccination of those between the age groups of 18 to 44 years, it is taxpayer\\'s money.\\n\\nThe government has not invoked compulsory licensing for vaccines despite repeated calls by Congress?\\nDr Manmohan Singh asked for compulsory licensing in his letter to the Prime Minister. The Congress President has repeated it several times now. Other countries have done this. The USA ramped up its vaccine production using their Defense Production Act. We have to do whatever it takes, within our laws, to ramp up the domestic production of vaccines here. We have a domestic manufacturing base. We can manufacture for both India and the world. All the industry needs are licenses and raw materials. It should have been done months ago.\\n\\nThe Congress party has said it is willing to work together with the Centre in the fight against Coronavirus. How will you make it accountable then?\\nCongress Party has said from day one that it is willing to work with the government in the fight against Coronavirus and for a year now, even in just the last few days, the Congress President has repeated this position very clearly. We have been consistently giving suggestions on all possible forums. Forget taking them seriously, the government has not even meaningfully acknowledged these suggestions. I see no contradiction in working together with the government in times of unprecedented crisis while at the same time holding it accountable for its decisions. The problem arises when the government doesn\\'t believe in consultation, in carrying everyone along, in tapping expertise it lacks. This government seems to think that acknowledging help is needed is a sign of weakness. The hubris and pettiness of this government are unbelievable.\\n\\nThe Madras High Court has held the Election Commission responsible for the Covid situation. Your views?\\nThe Court was echoing a widely held view. In the past 7 years, like so many other institutions, the Election Commission of India has also crumbled. The Court has said what it believes, I don\\'t want to make any further comment. Let your readers judge for themselves. Our Institutions are a warning system- they give us feedback and information on how to respond to crisis but our institutions have been completely destroyed and taken over. The press, judiciary, election commission, bureaucracy - none of them have played their role of guardian/watchdog. This means India today is like a ship in a storm, sailing without any information. Corona is just part of the problem - the real problem is that India now doesn\\'t have the capacity to respond to any major crisis because of what has been done to its systems over the last 6 years.\\n\\nThere have been demands within for internal elections and a new Congress president? Are you ready to lead again in such times, especially when there are demands from various quarters within for you to lead?\\nI have always favoured internal organisational elections within the Congress and these will be conducted in time. It is for the party workers to decide as to who should lead the party. I will do whatever the party wants me to do. But right now the focus is on controlling the pandemic, saving lives, and alleviating India\\'s widespread suffering and pain. There will be time for everything else in due course.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRahul GandhiCongress LeadersHospital BedsModi GovtOxygen Supply\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n4 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nGuest Login\\n115 days ago\\nTimepass feku... no actions , no work , no ideas , no inspiration, no brain.... just words words words\\nKish Sh\\n117 days ago\\nWE AS INDIANS ASSURE YOU PROMPT CREMATORIUM AVAILABILITY ASAP ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBLIGE YOU.\\nShyam VS\\n119 days ago\\nWhen the nation is throwing everything it has on the monster, and praying for the best, Mr Gandhi comes to address the nation from his inherited pulpit.

       " 'Synopsis\\nA bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which held a four-hour-long special hearing on a holiday on various issues relating to the COVID-19 situation, said it appears there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes.\\nGetty Images\\nThe Delhi High Court Saturday directed all hospitals in the national capital to provide information on daily admissions and discharge of COVID-19 patients and of those admitted for over 10 days, since April 1. A concern was raised in the court regarding optimal utilisation of ICU and oxygenated beds and ICU beds in hospitals and nursing homes across Delhi.\\n\\nA bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which held a four-hour-long special hearing on a holiday on various issues relating to the COVID-19 situation, said it appears there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes.\\n\\n\"Looking into the dearth and shortage of beds, particularly oxygen beds and beds in ICU, we consider it necessary to have this aspect looked into as there are allegations of malpractice of patients not being discharged despite having recovered from the COVID-19 disease,\" the bench said.\\n\\nIt said, \"We direct the medical superintendents/ owners/ doctors of all hospitals and nursing homes, including those of Delhi government, Centre and private, to place details of the number of COVID-19 patients admitted and discharged each day from April 1.\"\\n\\nThey shall also give details of the number of patients who have remained hospitalised for 10 days or more and the type of bed occupied by them from April 1.\\n\\nThe bench said the details shall be emailed by May 4 to amicus curiae and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao who shall combine the information and place it before the court on May 5.\\n\\nIt also directed the Delhi government to forthwith update its portal about admission and discharge of COVID-19 patients from hospitals and to also keep it updated daily without fail.\\n\\nIt said the number of hospital beds available on the portal shall separately show how many of them are oxygenated and non-oxygenated.\\n\\n\"From what has emerged, it is well known that one who contracts COVID-19, takes about 10-14 days to recover in normal course... about 10 per cent of them require hospitalisation and 1 per cent of the total affected persons are likely to require greater medical intervention and admission to ICU,\" the court noted.\\n\\nDelhi government counsel Satyakam submitted that in Delhi, there are a total of 20,938 beds for COVID-19 patients as on date in all hospitals here and the data include non-oxygenated, oxygenated, ICU beds.\\n\\nTo this, the bench said looking to this number, every day a substantial number of beds should become available for the patients, but that does not appear to be happening.\\n\\nThe patients who require hospitalisation with oxygen support should normally be in a position to leave the hospital within 8-10 days subject to the condition, unless it worsens and requires ICU, the court said, adding that in most cases, COVID-19 resolves itself in 10 days to two weeks with medicines.\\n\\n\"However it appears that there is choking of beds taking place in hospitals and nursing homes,\" the bench said.\\n\\nSenior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, showed an office order by Directorate General of Health Services on the new discharge policy and also a document of the medical director of LNJP Hospital which stated that patients are staying in hospitals beyond seven days.\\n\\n\"\"Therefore, all unit heads and consultants are requested to discharge patients as per the revised discharge policy of the government so that more lives can be saved. Stable patients whose oxygen saturation is more than 91 per cent may be shifted to GNEC, Shehnai banquet and Rouse Avenue School,\" the hospital order said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the court also said hospitals should learn from their experiences regarding oxygen scarcity during the prevailing pandemic and set up plants for generating the life-saving gas.\\n\\nIt said for commercial considerations, some hospitals reduce capital expenditures on things like oxygen plants which are essential in a hospital, especially the big ones, and it is irresponsible not to have such plants.\\n\\nMehra also informed the court that a hospital in the name of Gandhi Hospital on Friday made a false statement that it has not received a single oxygen cylinder for the last 48 hours, despite getting various.\\n\\nThe hospital\\'s owner submitted that there was some mis-communication between the management and their lawyer and there was no intention to make a false statement.\\n\\nThe court warned that such false claims shall not be made in future, particularly at this time as it wastes time and takes away time of the administration which is dealing with the situation on war footing.\\n\\nRegarding a plea by a group of lawyers including Bar Council of Delhi chairman Ramesh Gupta seeking arrangement for treatment of lawyers contracting COVID-19, Mehra said they were working on it and something positive will come up by Monday.\\n\\nAnother plea was mentioned by Dwarka Court Bar Association President Y P Singh seeking to make operation Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka, which has been under construction for the last 8 years and near completion now, which could accommodate 1700 beds.\\n\\nThe court asked the government to take instruction on this and apprise it with the development.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nBar Council Of DelhiCovidCovid PatientsDirectorate General Of Health ServicesDelhi High CourtLnjp Hospital\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

That's up from $5.87 billion, or $3,617.62 per Class A share a year ago.\\n\\nThe four analysts surveyed by FactSet expected Berkshire to report operating earnings of $3,792.36 per Class A share.\\n\\nBerkshire continued its streak of major stock repurchases by investing $6.6 billion in its own stock during the quarter. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company spent $25 billion on repurchases last year. Seifert said investors will applaud the significant buybacks.\\n\\nBut Berkshire is still sitting on $145.4 billion in cash and short-term investments because Buffett has struggled to find major acquisitions for the company for several years.\\n\\n``They're just not really putting a lot of capital to work,'' Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said.\\n\\nLater Saturday, Buffett will spend several hours answering questions at an online version of Berkshire's annual meeting. Buffett will be joined by Berkshire vice chairmen Charlie Munger, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain.\\n\\nInvestor Cole Smead said Berkshire has largely been sitting on the sidelines in recent years without making major investments, and he'd love to see the company get more active the next time the market swoons. When the pandemic devastated markets a year ago, Berkshire took a cautious approach.\\n\\n``We do not question whether Buffett and Munger have patience. That's obvious. The question is do they have any aggression. That's not obvious,'' Smead said.\\n\\nSeifert said Buffett and Munger may face some tough questions about Berkshire's lack of corporate policies on climate change and social justice issues. Buffett has said he is largely leaving it up to Berkshire's subsidiaries to address those issues.\\n\\n``I think investors have the right to know what their views are on these issues. And so far they have not really been forthcoming at all,'' Seifert said..\\n\\nWhat will be missing at Saturday's meeting will be the thousands of people who normally show up to hear from Buffett and Munger.\\n\\nThis was the second year in a row that Berkshire's meeting was on online-only affair because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year's event was moved outside of Omaha for the first time -- to Los Angeles to be near where the 97-year-old Munger lives.\\n\\nThe meeting usually draws 40,000 to Omaha, filling a 18,300-seat arena and every nearby overflow room. No other company matches those crowds.\\n\\nAuthor Bob Miles said he'll miss ``mingling with like-minded and self-selected shareholders'' and talking with executives who run Berkshire subsidiaries who routinely spend part of the meeting in their company's booth in the 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall that adjoins the arena. Berkshire companies like Geico insurance, See's Candy and Fruit of the Loom sell their products to shareholders each year.\\n\\nThe fun of the meeting isn't just for shareholders. Jim Weber, who runs Berkshire's Brooks Running, said he longs for the chance to compare notes with fellow Berkshire managers at the one annual event that brings together the leaders of the decentralized conglomerate's dozens of subsidiaries.\\n\\n``We certainly miss that opportunity to connect with our peers,'' said Weber, adding that he would likely watch some of this year's event from a treadmill or stationary bike.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. owns more than 90 companies, including the BNSF railroad and insurance, utility, furniture and jewelry businesses. The company also has major investments in such companies as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola and Bank of America.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWarren Buffett AGMBerkshire AGMWarren Buffett LiveWarren Buffett AddressWarren BuffettBerkshire Hathaway\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

       " 'Synopsis\\nElection rallies and others may have contributed a small fraction but please look at the totality and context of the overall behaviour seen in the country, even among enlightened sections of people, says Ashutosh Sharma.\\nWhile scientific studies are still on, the strains look more infective, says Ashutosh Sharma.\\nDepartment of Science & Technology secretary Ashutosh Sharma spoke to ET on the second wave of the pandemic, the new strains of the coronavirus, the lessons before us and the role of elections and Kumbh in spreading the infection. Excerpts:\\n\\nOn second wave alerts\\nOur own modelling studies and various other studies, none of them predicted the scale, intensity and the ferocity that we see now. The country was prepared for a surge of less than a lakh per day as a lot of resources were built in the first wave for it.\\n\\nThe ( supermodel) committee gave an informal alert in March and held its last meeting with ( member-health) Dr VK Paul on April 2 where the prediction was of India hitting the peak in the third-fourth week of April with an intensity of less than a lakh per day. Clearly what was predicted was far short of the reality, probably because inputs to the model changed — mutations in the virus which probably required less loading for the disease to take hold.\\n\\nI say clearly that there was no other input, and not one of them, that was an alarming input, as far as science is concerned.\\n\\n\\nand others may have contributed a small fraction but please look at the totality and context of the overall behaviour seen in the country, even among enlightened sections of people. It had become pervasive.\\n\\n\\nI don’t think one can fault the messaging. The messaging was always there. Mathematical models also clearly and emphatically said that the behaviour of the virus was linked to that of the people. It is a difficult situation, we cannot just be blaming each other. The important thing is to take charge of the situation and follow some simple things like masking as well as one can and ensuring adequate ventilation to check the spread of infection.\\n\\n\\nWhile scientific studies are still on, the strains look more infective. It is argued that the transmission is happening through aerosol. It is still under study how much viral load is leading to the onset of disease.\\n\\nComparatively, a small fraction is showing severe symptoms but it is not clear how that selection happens. Comorbidity and obesity are indicators. So was age but now it is shifting to a younger population that was not infected before — like fire to fuel. Several ongoing global studies and at our labs will give greater insight over time.\\n\\n\\nFirst, it educates us about the past. It is now clear if we did not have the lockdown last year, the onset would have been far worse.\\n\\nThe second wave also shows that we must be continuously prepared. We need to seed deep expertise and infrastructure in research, in modelling and crisis response. These are long-term studies that require matching resources as well.\\n\\n\\nWe are working in repurposing of oxygen plants and we have identified several startups and industries for oxygen production. Some new designs have also come up which we are sharing. However, the real bottleneck just now is supply and logistics. That is being addressed by expert groups.\\n\\n\\nWe had no inkling the scale would be so huge. While we were totally prepared, the intensity is too high. This is not in contradiction with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ idea. It is unprecedented scale and the need to supply at speed which is the determining factor here. We should do so (imports) in a crisis. All countries do it.',\n",
       " 'Synopsis\\nThere was initially a joint boycott announcement by the English Football Association, English Premier League, English Football League, Women’s Super League, Women’s Championship as well as player, manager and referee bodies, antidiscrimination group Kick It Out, and the Women In Football group.\\nAgencies\\nThe abuse Tottenham interim coach Ryan Mason received was after he suffered a fractured skull which forced him to retire at age 26 in 2018.\\nThere will be no goal clips, lineup announcements, banter between clubs or even title celebrations. Four days of silence across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram by football leagues, clubs and players in England began on Friday in a protest against racist abuse that has been adopted more widely. Such is the anger across the game, it means that if Manchester City clinches the Premier League on Sunday it will not celebrate the title on social media.\\n\\nWHO IS BOYCOTTING?\\nThere was initially a joint boycott announcement by the English Football Association, English Premier League, English Football League, Women’s Super League, Women’s Championship as well as player, manager and referee bodies, antidiscrimination group Kick It Out, and the Women In Football group. Ahead of the boycott which began at 1400 GMT (1930 IST) on Friday through 2259 GMT on Monday (0430 IST Tuesday), other English sports including cricket, rugby, tennis and horse racing said they would fall silent on social media.\\n\\nFIFA, UEFA and the Premier League’s British broadcasters also said they wouldn’t post online across four days.\\n\\nPrince William, who is president of the FA, said on the Kensington Palace Twitter account he would be joining the boycott. Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, who is the only Black driver on the grid, announced he wouldn’t post during the Portuguese Grand Prix weekend to help “make a difference for future generations.” The International Tennis Federation joined the boycott in the hope it stops vile abusive messages, including death threats, being sent to players, coaches and officials.\\n\\nWHY PROTEST?\\nThe English players’ union led a move to boycott social media for 24 hours in 2019 — called the “Enough” campaign — to demand tougher action to stop hatred being sent online to their members. It hasn’t come, with no zero tolerance. For Facebook-owned Instagram, a racist post isn’t enough to get a user immediately suspended.\\n\\n“It’s dreadful,” said Simone Pound, head of equalities at the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA). “When we first went to them after the Enough campaign I had reams and reams of the examples of the abuse players are receiving. We had (Leicester captain) Wes Morgan in the room talking from a personal level. There was the N-word everywhere, monkey emojis everywhere and they were like, ‘We’re really sorry. It doesn’t contravene our community guidelines.”’\\n\\n\\n\\nNot much has improved after two years, according to Pound. “Since we first met with them, they appreciate that isn’t a good enough response or answer,” Pound said. “However, we are still seeing and know that those words, those emojis are being used in a horrific way, daily to players and they aren’t always being taken down quickly. Sometimes they are still up six months after being reported.”\\n\\nInstagram’s moves to eradicate racism have focused on action against abusive direct messages more than public posts.\\n\\nTWITTER INACTION\\nThe PFA found that 31 out of 56 racist and discriminatory tweets remain live on Twitter as of Thursday despite reporting them last year. Like Facebook, Twitter would not provide anyone for interview to discuss claims they are strengthening moves to remove discriminatory content and abusive users.\\n\\nA study by the anti-discrimination Fare network with Belgium-based artificial intelligence company Textgain found that 157 players involved in the quarterfinals of the Champions League and Europa League last August received discriminatory abuse on Twitter. Six months later, 66% of discriminatory tweets remained online as did 71% of the accounts, Fare said, pointing out that while ethnic minority players receive more racist abuse, there is homophobic abuse sent to players across the game.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT ACTION\\nThe British government is introducing a law to address online safety that could lead to social media companies being fined for failing to crack down on racism. “We could see fines of up to 10% of annual global turnover,” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden wrote in Friday’s edition of The Sun newspaper.\\n\\n“For a company such as Facebook or YouTube, that could be billions.”\\n\\nMANAGERS\\nThe boycott started as managers were holding news conferences ahead of the weekend’s matches. Wolverhampton’s Nuno Espirito Santo, the only Black manager in the Premier League, flagged issues about withdrawing from public information platforms.\\n\\n“Not everyone on social media uses it badly,” he said of the boycott. “You’ve to balance and we can’t compromise our freedom, but at the moment I think it’s a good measure.”\\n\\nThe abuse Tottenham interim coach Ryan Mason received was after he suffered a fractured skull which forced him to retire at age 26 in 2018.\\n\\n“I had to zone out of it and had to take myself off social media as a player because I didn’t want to see it,” Mason said. “Even after I retired I’d get messages about my injury and certain things, and you almost think it’s another message and I’ll just ignore it. But these things shouldn’t be acceptable.”\\n\\nBANNED BY CLUBS\\nManchester United announced on Friday that six fans have been banned for racially abusing Tottenham forward Son Heung-min on social media. United also found in a review of Twitter, Instagram and Facebook that 3,300 abusive posts were aimed at their players from September 2019 to February 2021. Chelsea also said that a supporter had been banned for 10 days for antisemitic posts.\\n\\nWHAT’S NEXT?\\nThe PFA is preparing for more blackouts on social media. “I personally feel this could be the first of a series of boycotts,” Pound said. “We can do this every week if we have to. This is not going away. They have to listen to us.”\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nGovernmentUnitedUefaSocial MediaChampions LeaguePremier League\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " 'Synopsis\\nVaccinating all adults, some 90 crore Indians, is fraught with multiple challenges. These include a massive shortage of jabs, friction between the Centre and some states, confusion arising out of differential pricing and, above all, the severity of the current wave, which has jammed the nation’s healthcare infrastructure and even forced many youngsters to worry whether vaccination centres could emerge as super spreading spots.\\nReuters\\nAfter Nayana Achamma, a BA student in Kerala, cast her vote for the first time on April 6, she has been all agog to know the results of the assembly elections which will be out on May 2. But closer to the date, the anticipation for the results got supplanted by her eagerness for the Covid-19 vaccine, which opened for all adults from May 1.\\n\\n“Right now, I just want to get the vaccine as fast as possible,” says the 18-year-old. “The second wave has returned with a lot more intensity. The sooner we get the vaccine, the better, right?” she reasons. When registrations opened for everyone above 18 years on the at 4 pm on April 28, Achamma was able to register after multiple attempts but to her disappointment, did not get a slot. “I’ll try again,” she says.\\n\\nOn May 1, the day vaccination took off, only a few states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat could start the process, that too, symbolically, in a few districts. Most states missed the launch against a gloomy backdrop of acute vaccine shortage and a second surge of Covid-19 that has turned lethal, not sparing the younger lot, either.\\n\\nTill now, barely 2% of India’s 1.35 billion population — mainly healthcare and security personnel plus some senior citizens — have got both the doses of the Covid-19 vaccines. Only this tiny proportion is somewhat shielded from the brutal new wave that has plunged entire cities and villages in despair and mourning. About 100 million, i.e. less than 8% of the population, have taken only one dose. In the last 24 hours India saw over 4 lakh Covid cases, the highest single-day spike globally, and 3,523 deaths.\\n\\n\\nUnquestionably, at this juncture, vaccines are the basic armour against the virus and mass inoculation is the need of the hour. The very fact that 133 million citizens registered on the Co-WIN portal on April 28, the day people in the 18-44 years age cohort was permitted to enrol, demonstrates how younger Indians are willing and eager to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest. However, vaccinating all adults, some 90 crore Indians, is fraught with multiple challenges. These include a massive shortage of jabs, friction between the Centre and some states, confusion arising out of differential pricing and, above all, the severity of the current wave, which has jammed the nation’s healthcare infrastructure and even forced many youngsters to worry whether vaccination centres could emerge as superspreading spots.\\n\\nCardiac surgeon and chairman of Medanta, , argues that hospitals still have enough capacity, appealing young Indians with no symptoms to come forth and get themselves vaccinated as early as possible. “Unlike the last time, the number of younger people who got infected and even died during this wave is out of proportion. I would like the younger lot to get vaccinated soon. Self-defence includes wearing a mask and getting vaccinated,” says Trehan, adding that the impact of the virus on those who have already got two shots is milder.\\n\\nShobana Kamineni, executive vicechairperson of , echoed a similar view when ET spoke to her last week. “The more we vaccinate, the less will be the problem. The pandemic has to be tamed just like a forest fire. Right now, the fire is everywhere. Once more and more people get vaccinated and acquire immunity, there will only be small eruptions here and there, and only those need to be clamped down,” she said.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is evident that scaling up of vaccination will alleviate the problem although it cannot immediately arrest the exploding number of cases as it takes time for immunity to build. The question is: How soon can India do that? Does India have enough vaccines to cover everyone above 18? In an email reply to ET’s queries, Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII), says his company is scaling up production capacity from the present level of 60-70 million doses per month. “By July we hope to produce 100 million doses monthly,” he says. SII has been manufacturing Covishield, one of the two vaccines currently in use in India, the other being Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.\\n\\nTo the question of SII’s commitment to states and private hospitals, Poonawalla replies he can’t share specific details at this juncture. “As per the recent GoI directive, 50% of our capacity will be reserved for the Union government and the remaining 50% will be for state governments and private hospitals. That said, at this stage, it would be difficult to share specific details.”\\n\\nMost states are aware they won’t receive adequate vaccine supplies to cater to the new demand. While BJP-ruled states are largely silent on the matter, those ruled by other parties, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, have openly expressed their anger and apprehension, saying they don’t have enough stocks. Nor have they received any firm commitment or timeline from suppliers to cover the age cohort of 18-44, they say. This is even as private hospital chains like Apollo, Fortis and Max began vaccination for this age group on May 1.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you probe a little more, the friction between the Centre and states comes to the fore. States that are not ruled by the BJP are worried about the possibility of the Centre taking the entire credit for the exercise even as it washes its hands of it and makes the states contribute to the cost of vaccines for 18-44-year-olds.\\n\\nHealth Minister of Chhattisgarh, TS Singh Deo, minces no words when he says: “It is petty to say so, but the certificate coming out of Co-WIN portal will have the prime minister’s photo. However, for vaccinating 18-plus, states will also pay. Our state, for example, is paying some Rs 1,000-1,200 crore. We wanted our own portal, but the Centre has not agreed to our proposal.” Chhattisgarh has placed an order for 25 lakh doses of Covishield and an equal quantity of Covaxin.\\n\\nVaccine supplies for the new phase have become more complicated with the Centre announcing that states will have to procure doses for the 18-44 years cohort directly from manufacturers. Vaccine makers have been instructed to reserve half the output for the Centre and the remaining doses for states and the private sector, with differential pricing for each. This is in contrast with the Union government’s policy on universal immunisation until now, with the Centre buying the doses and distributing it among the states. “All these decades, the central government always procured vaccines and supplied them to the states. Due to its huge market, India always got very competitive prices. In fragmented markets and at a time when the product is scarce and demand is high, the seller is at a huge advantage,” says K Sujatha Rao, former secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.\\n\\nAdditionally, to have 30 states enter into individual contracts, ensure supplies and do quality assurance checks would be duplication with no advantage and end up wasting huge amounts of time for overworked health departments, she argues Then there is the vexing issue of pricing, with the manufacturers announcing different prices for the Centre, states and the private sector. Vaccines that are directly imported, by private players or states, will be priced separately. Uttar Pradesh, for example, has announced that it would float a global tender to import 40 million doses.\\n\\n\\nIndian manufacturers have announced the price list. One dose of Covaxin will be sold for Rs 1,200 to private hospitals, Rs 400 to states and for Rs 150 to the Centre. As far as Covishield is concerned, SII is charging Rs 600 from private hospitals, Rs 300 from states and Rs 150 from the Centre.\\n\\n“A business that is in the business of earning profits will sell to one offering a higher price, in this case the private parties. So where do the states stand in the queue?” asks Rao. Considering India has so far practised equitable vaccination with the government procuring the vaccine for all government entities, there was no reason to deviate from that now, she says. “The private sector, if it so wishes, can collaborate with the government and provide the vaccine at a nominal fee or buy vaccines in India and abroad and make a variety available for those who can afford those prices,” she says.\\n\\nSII’s Poonawalla argues that charging higher rates from select customers is important as he would need more resources for ramping up the production capacities of his factories: “The initial supply price of Covishield for government programmes, including in India, has been the lowest. Private market price is 3-4 times higher. This is partly due to large volumes and because a majority of the population gets vaccinated for free through the government. We must, however, be able to sustain and reinvest in scaling up our capacity and save lives.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, India Inc has begun purchasing vaccines directly. ITC, for example, has decided to support all its eligible employees and their family members with vaccination under the company’s medical assistance policy, with support for vaccination also being extended to service providers and partners in the value chain across the country, according to Amitav Mukherji, head of the corporate human resources of the company.\\n\\nDr Satyajit Rath, an immunologist with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune, warns that vaccination will not have an immediate effect on the current, ongoing surge – “that will play out over the next few weeks since it takes at least three weeks after a vaccine dose for people to acquire any immunity”. “Covid-19 vaccine reduces the chances of catching infection, but does not make it zero, and reduces the chances of dying of Covid-19 even more, but does not make even that zero,” he adds, emphasising that there should be clear, sober messaging on vaccination.\\n\\nHowever, the biggest challenge now is simply the lack of supply of adequate doses of vaccines. While India produces about 80 million doses a month of Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines which have received emergency use authorisation, public health professionals say the situation will only exacerbate with the expansion of vaccination drive. “Neither Serum Institute nor Bharat Biotech will have adequate supplies in May. We have raised expectations and demand without sufficient supply — that’s going to hit state governments in a big way, unless they come out and say they are not going to start in May and that they will do so in June or July,” says Dr N Devadasan, who has worked in public health for over three decades and is currently a technical advisor to Health Systems Transformation Platform, set up by Tata Trusts.\\n\\nDr Rath, too, cautions against raising expectations at a time of severe shortage of vaccines. “Vaccination campaigns need to ensure the reliability of vaccine availability; the current situation of uncertainty where people make online appointments which are cancelled at the last moment or worse, end up with no vaccine supply at the centres, increase vaccine hesitancy. Not much may be promised, but what is promised needs to be delivered,” he says. With supplies likely to change from week to week, Dr Rath says states’ decision-making around the vaccine drive must be dynamic and flexible to accommodate this. He suggests that states must include in priority groups those at risk of serious outcomes of infection (such as the elderly and those with co-morbidities) and those with a high likelihood in major transmission points.\\n\\n\\nThe current vaccine policy could lead to inequity as well, as larger states might be able to negotiate a better price than others, says Dr Devadasan. “You could end up having huge variations among states. Also, some states have announced that they will give vaccines for free while others have not — will the latter be charging patients? That could then be a significant amount.” The Union government, he says, must intervene because vaccines are a public good.\\n\\n\\nGlobally, governments have been providing Covid vaccines to residents for free, including in the United States. Indonesia is one of the few countries which has allowed its private sector to pursue a separate plan to procure doses and launch vaccine drives but even there, companies cannot make employees pay for it. Though some people might be reluctant to risk infection by stepping out to get the vaccine, Dr Rath says chances of infection in a hospital or vaccination centre are less simply because masking and related rules are strictly enforced. “The locations where the infection is likely being transmitted are households and small social gatherings and marketplaces where masking and physical distancing are not well maintained.”\\n\\n\\nAnother hurdle in maximising vaccination, say experts, is the clause that 18-44-yearolds have to mandatorily register online. Dr Prashanth NS, a faculty member at the Institute of Public Health, says that in the previous phases, nearly everyone who came to get vaccinated at primary health centres in and around BR Hills in Karnataka’s Chamarajanagar district — the predominantly rural and tribal region where he is based — walked in, without prior registration. “Once you say registration is required, that will be a huge exclusionary barrier for several people who are more in need of the vaccine than others,” he says.\\n\\nIt’s meaningless to argue that there is high penetration of smartphones in rural areas because that does not immediately mean an ability to register and use apps. In and around BR Hills, for instance, Prashanth says there has not been much enthusiasm for the vaccine — in that context, the additional barrier of online registration will only hamper immunisation efforts. “Never in the history of our country have we required registration for vaccination. We’ve done vaccination very well with ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwife) — why are we not leveraging that, instead of using apps?” he asks.\\n\\nOne concern flagged by Dr V Ravi, virologist and former professor at NIMHANS, is the low uptake of vaccination among elders. States, he suggests, could continue with the previous strategy of prioritisation, in the face of supply constraints. “At least 80% of elders should be saturated first, then those with co-morbidities and, finally, the youngsters.” This has been the strategy followed by countries like the UK where vaccination was finally opened to those below the age of 50 years in descending order of age after everyone in the priority category had got at least one dose.\\n\\nIn India, since the rollout of vaccines in mid-January, the jab graph formed humps with occasional falls in between due to supply shortage, festivals and the recent surge of Covid cases. With the rising Covid numbers and deaths in places like Delhi, the graph is worrying. It’s likely that the newly eligible cohort of 18-44 years will propel the jab graph northward once more. After all, vaccines are one ray of hope for Indians battling the pandemic.',\n",

Soli Jehangir Sorabjee, India’s former attorney general and a legal luminary who passed away on Friday morning at a private hospital in Delhi where he was being treated for Covid-19 was associated with both these landmark rulings. In the first, Sorabjee, along with Fali Nariman, assisted Nanabhoy Palkhivala who argued for Kesavananda Bharati. In the Maneka Gandhi case, he was representing the government as an additional solicitor general.\\n\\nIn the Maneka Gandhi case, the court praised the attorney general and the additional solicitor general for their “commendable grace and perceptive and progressive realism” in agreeing to “the happy resolution” of the dispute. Sorabjee was 91 and is survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons. His daughter, Zia Mody, is an eminent lawyer and a co-founder of law firm AZB & Partners. A Padma Vibhushan recipient, Sorabjee was also a jazz aficionado and used to play the clarinet as well.\\n\\n“Being a champion of ‘Freedom of Press’, he effectively used the media as a platform to elucidate the nuances of complicated legal issues on almost daily basis till recently, literally giving lessons of law to millions of common people who otherwise could not have followed what was happening in the judicial world,” Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said in his statement. “His humane and compassionate approach defined his legal work.

Subsequently, he became a member of the UN Sub Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.

In 1971, Sorabjee was designated as a senior advocate by the Supreme Court.

The rollout of the new phase began in certain pockets in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat and Odisha and in select centres of private hospital chains Apollo Hospitals, Max Healthcare and Fortis Healthcare.\\n\\nIn Mumbai, 1,000 people were inoculated, the target set by the city’s civic body, with this number to be raised to 2,500 on Sunday. “We decided to vaccinate 200 people from the 18-44 age category today at five centres and we have fully achieved this target. Each centre was supposed to vaccinate 200 people,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI.\\n\\nVaccination for this phase is only through prior registration with walk-ins disallowed. In New Delhi, Max Healthcare had said the drive would begin at some of its hospitals even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had made it clear the national capital would not join the rollout on Saturday as doses had not arrived. Apollo Hospitals sources told PTI that the immunisation at its hospitals in Delhi was likely to begin by Monday or Tuesday.\\n\\nThe Uttar Pradesh government began the “Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3” vaccinations in seven districts which had clocked over 9,000 Covid-19 cases each - Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Bareilly. Gujarat kicked off the new phase in 10 districts most affected by the pandemic, including Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Gandhinagar.\\n\\nThe drive was launched in a limited number of districts as Gujarat has received only three lakh doses from the vaccine manufacturers as against the order of 2.5 crore doses placed by the state government, officials told PTI. Authorities in Ahmedabad said they have set up 76 vaccination centres. The rollout starts at a time when many states are reporting a shortage of vaccines though the Centre’s report available till 8 am on Saturday says over 79 lakh Covid vaccine doses are still available with the states and Union Territories to be administered.\\n( Originally published on May 01, 2021 )\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUddhav ThackerayKarnatakaMaharashtraSerum Institute Of IndiaBharat BiotechVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",
       " 'Synopsis\\nRobert O. Mendelsohn teaches environmental economics at Yale University.\\nET Bureau\\nRobert O. Mendelsohn teaches environmental economics at Yale University. Speaking to ET, he discusses President Joe Biden’s 2030 timeline for the US to halve its greenhouse gas emissions, the likely impacts of climate change on India — and the importance of global synergy in climate mitigation schemes:\\n\\nPresident Biden has announced a 2030 target for the US to halve its emissions — which American industries are likely to change most rapidly?\\nThis depends on the programs President Biden can actually implement — his first target will be to incentivise American utilities to go as carbon-free as possible by 2030. His second target will be transportation. However, this is a much more difficult sector to wean away from oil, gasoline and diesel than power as these fuels are much cheaper relatively for transport. Switching to electricity-based transportation will be more expensive and harder to accomplish. Major emitters in manufacturing will also be affected. But President Biden’s overall chances of success will be tied to the cooperation he gets from the legislature which wi l l need to support more efficient mitigation mechanisms like carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes.\\n\\nWhat is your assessment of the economic impacts of climate change on India?\\nMy research indicates that the bulk of global climate damages will bear down worryingly on low latitude countries like India. Countries like India which are closer to the equator could endure up to 80% of the global damage of climate impacts. The primary reason therefore to think of climate change as a global challenge is to help reduce the damage in such countries. Ironically, it’s hard to convince many countries to invest in climate mitigation because they don’t want to spend on something that seems to benefit another nation — this behaviour makes it harder to stop climate change.\\n\\nAgencies\\n\\nWhat are some recommendations you’d make to developed economies on mitigating global climate change?\\nI would first suggest establishing a carbon tax on emissions. This should be taxed at around ten dollars a ton of carbon. It should apply to main emitters and most mid-to high latitude economies, which are not going to be as hard hit by climate impacts, would thereby have to spend more on mitigation. Some countries are very poor and it would be unfair to burden them with the extra costs of climate mitigation. The world should help poorer households in those countries pay their share of mitigation costs — the energy expenditures of a poor household can be estimated and richer groups can increase climate aid to compensate for the higher costs of their moving to clean energy.\\n\\nThe science is extremely clear. Why are there still so many roadblocks in the path of mitigating climate change?\\nThere are two main reasons. Firstly, most mitigation schemes are still very expensive. And as much as most people would like to see climate change disappear, they are not willing to make a sacrifice to do this. Mitigations do require sacrifices in terms of lifestyles, profits, investments into renewables and so on. The second reason is that climate change is a global problem and not a national one. Even if India were to make huge reductions in its emissions, that won’t change the climate situation of India — it is only if the entire world were to make huge reductions that India’s climate situation would change. We don’t have global governance for this. Yet, this needs good global decisions.\\n\\nThe situation calls for a different approach now. I’d like to see every country do something about their own emissions — each nation should intensively research how it can reduce emissions inexpensively. Each country should establish a national carbon reduction target and find affordable solutions to reach this. That would be a practical start. The problem is that climate change is often approached by envisioning dramatic mitigation steps — but these are very expensive, so, in fact, few people want to carry these out. Most people in reality end up doing nothing at all. But there are also relatively affordable mitigations that will help us get started. To solve global climate change, we need a realistic middle ground between wanting to do nothing and trying to do too much.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nYale UniversityJoe BidenClimate MitigationEmissionsCarbon Tax\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\nANI\\nCOVID-19 CASES\\nWorld\\nIndia\\nConfirmed\\n32,695,030\\nDeaths\\n437,830\\nJaspreet Rai is desperately trying to do her part for the country she left more than 30 years ago: help its people breathe.\\n\\nRai, 53, who moved to Endicott, New York -- the birthplace of IBM -- from Punjab, in India, is the founder of Sanrai International, a provider of oxygen concentrators. With India now the epicenter of the pandemic, counting about 3,500 Covid-19 deaths daily, and oxygen supplies running out, Rai has rushed to help her former homeland cope with its worst crisis in recent history.\\n\\n“This is probably the hardest time they’re going through,” Rai said of her 100-strong staff on the ground, who will supply 30,000 units across India in May, several times the 1,500 Sanrai normally provides in a year. “When you don’t have equipment, and you’re trying to hold people, and they’re gasping, literally gasping for air. And you’re like, look, I’ve sold my last unit, I have to wait until the next stock comes in.”\\n\\nLike Rai, millions of Indians spread across the globe -- one of the world’s largest diasporas -- are trying to do what they can to help their country of origin as heart-wrenching images of people lining up for oxygen cylinders, waiting outside hospitals for a bed or huddling around funeral pyres flash across their screens. Some have been unable to do anything to save family members who have succumbed to the disease.\\n\\nThe number of daily new coronavirus cases in India on Saturday topped the 400,000 mark for the first time, pushing the total infections to more than 19 million. That milestone was crossed on a day when the nation opened its vaccination program to all adults.\\n\\nFeeling Helpless\\nThe diaspora is collecting funds, lobbying governments in countries where they reside and making pledges to shuttle essential supplies and equipment. But the scale of the task is leaving many feeling helpless as the health-care infrastructure in the world’s second-most populous country teeters on the brink of collapse.\\n\\n“They need doctors and hospitals,” said Venktesh Shukla, general partner at Monta Vista Capital in Silicon Valley. “I’ve been struggling for the last three to four days to figure out what to do. Like a lot of Indians, we want to do something. We just can’t find a short-term solution to help.”\\n\\nIn spite of that frustration, the need to “do something” in the face of the unfolding tragedy is spurring many into action.\\n\\nLike Sudhir Ravi. Little did Ravi know he would be embarking on a humanitarian mission when the Chicago-based private equity boutique TJM Capital Partners, where he is an operating partner, bought the largest U.S. supplier of military-grade oxygen generators in a strategic acquisition in April.\\n\\nBut with Covid raging, Ravi soon identified 11 industrial strength oxygen concentrators between the U.S. and Germany that can be distributed to hospitals in India. The devices can offer oxygen to 50,000 people in the next six months.\\n\\nFor the last week, he and Raghu Gullapalli, a close contact and executive director at the LV Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad, have been frantically looking for ways to get them to India, requesting the services of Amazon and FedEx. A consortium of Indian philanthropists have committed to cover the $100,000 cost of shipment, and Ravi said they’re hoping to get the cargo in the air on May 5.\\n\\n“Right now, time is measured in lives,” said Gullapalli.\\n\\nBillionaire Action\\nIndian-born billionaires and executives are also piling in with help. Tech investor Vinod Khosla tweeted that he’s willing to send supplies by the “planeload.” Google, headed by Sundar Pichai, promised $18 million in cash assistance to victims’ families and medical equipment. Microsoft Corp., led by CEO Satya Nadella, pledged to draw on the company’s network to provide essential supplies.\\n\\nIn the U.K., home to around two million Indians, aid has come from people like steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and Karan Bilimoria, who helped draw support from companies as the first Indian head of the Confederation of British Industry.\\n\\n“We are focused on getting this help that is desperately needed as quickly as possible,” said Bilimoria, whose company produces Cobra beer, a staple of Indian restaurants in the U.K. Air Liquide SA, the French gas supplier that helps create the bubbles in Bilimoria’s beer, has pledged its oxygen production in India to support Covid patients.\\n\\nMittal’s Indian operations are providing 210 metric tons of liquid oxygen a day. “Helping the people of India means helping India, and that’s crucial for the entire world,” he said in an emailed statement.\\n\\nThe charitable foundation of U.K.-based billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought supermarket chain Asda, donated 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) to four hospitals in the western Indian state of Gujarat, from where their family hails.\\n\\nVaccine Woes\\nAs life in the U.K. and the U.S. edges ever closer to pre-pandemic normal, for Indians abroad worrying about family and friends, the unequal access to vaccines is becoming evident. Only 2% of the people in India have been fully vaccinated compared with 30% in the U.S. and 21% in the U.K., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.\\n\\nMonta Vista’s Shukla said he and 60 other influential Indians lobbied to convince the Joe Biden administration to free up vaccine supplies and steroids. The U.S. has decided to start shipping drugs like AstraZeneca’s vaccine and Remdesivir to India.\\n\\nYet for all that, there’s only so much even powerful Indians can do remotely as raw material and equipment shortages, freight delays and labor limits hamper efforts on the ground.\\n\\n“There’s only so many oxygen concentrators available in the market,” said Jitesh Gadhia, a British politician and a trustee of the British Asian Trust who has helped lead the U.K. government’s response and engagement with suppliers. “I am concerned that so many people trying to buy a limited stock will just raise prices. What we need is more supply.”\\n\\nAnd that won’t be easy. While in Endicott Rai is trying to find charter flights to get around bottlenecks to transport her oxygen concentrators to India from China, she said units her company can provide in a month “could probably just be used in one day.”\\n\\nRai, who started her company after her asthmatic grandmother died in 2008 needing oxygen, said she’s saddened by the continued fight in India over something as essential as the air one breathes.\\n\\n“I couldn’t understand how something so basic as oxygen was so complicated,” she said. “And that question is what I’ve been trying to answer for the past 13 years.”\\n\\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin and Gina Turner.\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAmazonCovidIBMRaviCoronavirusGoogleRemdesivirPandemic\\n9 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nZillionaire\\n119 days ago\\nWonderful and very creditable.

The investment companies technically fall under the definition of ‘deemed ’ - and will hence be regulated by RBI.\\n\\nMost HNIs use investment vehicles to invest their personal wealth in an array of investments. Many hold equities in some of their listed companies through investment arms. “Some investment companies set up by ultra-rich HNIs for investments in listed and unlisted space fall under the definition of ‘deemed NBFCs’ and are regulated by the RBI,” said , managing partner at law firm SNG & Partners. “Most of these companies neither borrow a single penny nor lend money to third parties.”\\n\\nSeveral corporate and individuals have undertaken massive restructuring exercises to avoid being regulated by the central bank. As per the RBI data, there are 64 companies registered as CIC, including companies owned by Tatas, Aditya Birla, and . Mails sent to Tata group, Aditya Birla group, Bharti Airtel and JSW on Thursday did not elicit any response as of press time Friday. Apart from these 64 companies, most promoters and investors who have not registered their investment arms with the RBI will also be impacted.\\n\\nRBI has put certain conditions for considering any company as an NBFC even if it’s not into lending. These include if a company holds 90% of its assets in the form of equity shares and its asset size is more than Rs 100 crore. “Many HNIs had invested through companies and the net worth of these companies had skyrocketed in the last one year, resulting in them falling under a de-facto definition of NBFC,” said Uday Ved, partner at tax advisory firm KNAV. “These companies will now have to be restructured in a way that they do not fall under the technical definition of a deemed NBFC, but in all practical purposes these companies are not NBFCs.”\\n\\nThe fear is that if RBI was to regulate these investment arms, then this could lead to legal complications. In most cases, promoters want to make sure that either they restructure the investment arms as non-companies or add additional layering so that it doesn’t technically become a CIC. Many investors who have not registered their companies with the RBI are not aware that their investment arms are now technically NBFCs, legal experts said.\\n\\nWhile the impact is on large investors, the spurt in the stock markets in the last one year also means that several investors have seen their investment arms cross the Rs 100-crore mark, experts said.',\n",

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan-an anti-Pakistan militant group-was weakened by leadership losses, but recently announced its reunification with two splinter groups to bolster its capabilities,\" he said.\\n\\n\"While Pakistani intelligence continues to provide material support and safe haven to the Taliban, Islamabad continues to support Afghan peace efforts, encouraging the Taliban to engage in dialogue with the Afghan Government,\" he added.\\n\\nBerrier said that Pakistan\\'s relations with India continue to remain tense since New Delhi\\'s August 2019 revocation of Kashmir\\'s semiautonomous status.\\n\\nDuring the year, tensions with India probably will remain elevated, and concerted efforts by both sides to fully implement the February 25, 2021 ceasefire will be necessary to reduce tension along the Line of Control.\\n\\nPakistan perceives nuclear weapons as key to its national survival, specifically to counter the threat from India\\'s growing conventional force superiority, and likely will increase its nuclear stockpile in 2021.\\n\\nTo that end, Pakistan continues to modernise and expand its nuclear capabilities by conducting training with its deployed weapons and testing developmental missiles.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNarendra ModiIndian ArmyIndian NavyTalibanLine Of ControlForeign PolicyIndia\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n5 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nMuthukrishna Pitchumani\\n118 days ago\\nInsteasd of Modi if congo regime had been there, xiping would have been our present indian prime minister, india every part from north to south one by one, for filling congi coffers, being sold to PLA under MOU from Congi under the able leadership of Pappu and PC, keeping hundreds of more crores in virgin islands.\\nValerian Pereira\\n119 days ago\\nwhen the U.N and the world body is just watching..The aggressor.. trespassing our LAC..LAxman Rekha what are we expected to do?Its about time that inndia too work on Cber..AI..All High tech..defense projects and defend our Land and also protect the International communityas these big guys simply..walk into an Annexe what they want.where they wantHow?why?Time to be extremely Aggressive. and put the enemy in place.\\nBadri Vinayak\\n120 days ago\\n4 chinese soldiers?

The stock goes straight to hospitals from the distributors under supervision of the state government. In this chain of supply, the chemists are not involved, so they can\\'t be blamed for hoarding.\"\\n\\nElaborating on a large scale requirement of life saving drugs for critical Covid patients, Rajiv Singhal said that taking note of daily cases of around 3.75 lakh in India, at least 70,000 patients would need a Remdesivir injection. \"As each patient requires 6 vials, the country would need over 4 lakh Remdesivir injections every day. We hope as most manufacturers have ramped up their production, the crisis of short supply of Remdesivir would be over,\" the General Secretary of AIOCD added. According to him, other medicines like Fabiflu and Tocilizumab were also in shortage due to sudden surge in demand. In many cases stock is not reaching chemists. Besides there were problems in procuring raw material for manufacturing Fabiflu which comes from abroad.\\n\\nOn shortage of Betadine gargle, recommended for prevention of Covid-19 by many doctors, Rajiv Singhal said that due to a surge in demand of Betadine, its manufacturing company could not meet the present requirement of the market. \"Let me tell you, people who need one bottle of Betadine, now buy 4 bottles. Everyone who can afford, wants to store such drugs. Actually this type of mindset of storing crucial medicines at home, is the reason behind the present shortage of certain medicine since the past one month.

With results in from more than half of the S&P 500 companies, earnings are now expected to have risen 46% in the first quarter from the previous year, compared with forecasts of 24% growth at the start of the month, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Pfizer Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAbout 87% of reports have come in ahead of analysts\\' estimates for earnings per share, putting the quarter on track to have the highest beat rate on record going back to 1994, when Refinitiv began tracking the data.\\n\\nSome strategists say the stronger-than-expected earnings could drive a richly valued market higher still. The benchmark S&P 500 is trading at about 23 times forward earnings, above the long-average of about 15, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\n\"The earnings results are really not being fully priced in yet, and that\\'s because you\\'re seeing estimates for the back half of the year start to pick up now in response to this better-than expected environment. That says to us there\\'s still more room,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\\n\\nThe high percentage of beats also follows many quarters where companies were holding off on giving guidance on the future, making it harder for analysts to estimate results for this year.\\n\\nCiting stronger earnings, Jonathan Golub, chief US equity strategist and head of quantitative research at Credit Suisse Securities, on Friday raised his 2021 S&P 500 price target to 4,600 from 4,300. The S&P 500 index was last at about 4,180.\\n\\nStocks have had little reaction to results overall so far. The S&P 500 is up more than 11% since Dec. 31. The index is up less than 2% since mid-April when the earnings period kicked in to high gear, but remains near record highs.\\n\\nEarnings also are raising some fresh questions in the debate over growth versus value. After a decade of steadily under-performing the overall market, value has been a favorite among some investors as a bet on the reopening of the economy.\\n\\nHowever, \"tech is showing an ability ... to still create as good, if not superior, sales growth to cyclicals. That\\'s what I find amazing,\" said David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS.\\n\\n\"Tech is as much as of a reopening play as everybody else,\" he said. Investors will be watching reports in the weeks ahead to see if the trend continues. Results are expected next week from a wide range of companies including Activision Blizzard, Cummins Inc, ConocoPhillips and Pfizer Inc .\\n\\nThe first-quarter results come after a months-long rally in value stocks as investors bet on the reopening of businesses as COVID-19 vaccines became more available.\\n\\nValue has outperformed growth names that include heavily weighted technology stocks, and for the year so far, the Russell 1000 value index remains up about 15%, while the Russell 1000 growth index is up about 8% in that time.\\n\\nTechnology-related companies as well as banks - value trade favorites - have had the largest percentage point contribution to estimated first-quarter S&P 500 earnings, with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Apple Inc at the top of the list, based on Refinitiv\\'s data.\\n\\nTech is also among the strongest sectors for year-over-year sales growth for the quarter, Bianco noted.\\n\\nWhile the risks of higher inflation and possibly higher taxes have given some investors reason to become more cautious on growth shares, earnings may make them think twice about avoiding the group.\\n\\n\"It pays for a lot of investors to be balanced between value and growth,\" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\\n\\n\"We\\'re actually carving out a third group ... defensives,\" he said, adding that those are the areas for investors to avoid for now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nWall Street OutlookConocoPhillipsRefinitivPfizerJPMorgan Chase & CoPfizer IncWells Fargo Investment InstituteApple IncCredit Suisse Securities\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\nBy John Kemp\\n\\nLONDON: The US Federal Reserve has signalled it will tolerate faster inflation for a time to cement the post-pandemic recovery and boost employment, but the side effect is likely to be a faster rise in commodity prices.\\n\\nThe central bank appears anxious to avoid a repeat of the slow expansion and job gains that followed the financial crisis of 2008 by adopting a more aggressive approach to stimulating the recovery.\\n\\nIn March, non-farm employment was still down by more than 8 million jobs compared with its pre-pandemic peak in February 2020, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, leaving a large jobs gap to be filled.\\n\\nAfter its latest meeting on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee confirmed it will seek to achieve the twin objectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2% over the longer run.\\n\\nThe committee noted price rises have been running persistently below target, so it aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2% for some time to make up the shortfall and anchor expectations at around the 2% level.\\n\\nBut if the Fed leaves rates low to target the slackest part of the economy - the labour market - it must intensify pressure on capacity and prices in other parts of the economy, including manufacturing and raw materials.\\n\\nINFLATION AVERAGING\\nProposals for medium-term inflation-averaging have been winning adherents for some years, but the committee appears to be planning something more ambitious - an attempt to engineer a job-creating boom.\\n\\nThe plan is to run the economy hot to achieve faster job gains, especially among disadvantaged groups that are marginally attached to the labour force, before shifting back to inflation control later in the cycle.\\n\\nBut the resulting pressure on global supply chains while the Fed pursues employment increases is likely to generate significantly quicker price rises for raw materials and a range of manufactured items.\\n\\nBased on breakeven rates, bond traders are anticipating US consumer prices will rise at an average rate of 2.4% over the next ten years, compared with a realised average of 1.7% per year over the last decade.\\n\\nFor much of the last decade, expected inflation has been higher than the outturns, implying traders tend to overestimate price pressures.\\n\\nBut bond traders are probably correct for now, reacting to signs the Fed is prepared to tolerate significantly faster inflation to achieve faster employment gains.\\n\\nIS THERE AN UNDERSHOOT?\\nIn its statement, the Fed repeated its previous concerns about a persistent undershoot in the inflation rate, but there is no evidence for this, at least not since the middle of the last decade.\\n\\nPrice levels and inflation rates show no significant lasting impact from the coronavirus epidemic and recession in 2019, in contrast to the prolonged fall after the recession in 2008/09 and the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.\\n\\nConsumer prices have risen at an average rate of just over 2% per year over the last two years, three years and five years, according to the all-items consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\n\\nThe only evidence for a persistent undershoot is the 1.7% increase over the last ten years, influenced by unusually slow price increases between 2013 and early 2016.\\n\\nBased on the all-items consumer price index, both the rate of inflation and the level of consumer prices are in line with their long-term trend, and there is no undershoot to make up.\\n\\nThe Fed prefers more specialised measures of inflation, including the deflator for personal consumption expenditures, which is part of the national income and product accounts.\\n\\nPCE inflation has been running at 1.6-1.8% per year over the last two, three and five-year periods, and as little as 1.5% over the last ten years, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis.\\n\\nBut PCE inflation has been below 2% almost continuously since 2014, so if the Fed wants to make up for all that undershooting, it implies much faster price increases for an extended period.\\n\\nTIGHT SUPPLY CHAINS\\nThe problem with the Fed’s new inflation averaging strategy is that it fails to specify the historical baseline from which deviations are being measured.\\n\\nWhen exactly did consumer prices move below their desired level and how much of that deviation does the central bank want to reverse and over what time horizon?\\n\\nThe lack of clarity is probably intentional since it gives the central bank flexibility to interpret if the target has been achieved and when to start tapering its bond-buying programme and raising interest rates.\\n\\nBut the strategy strongly suggests the central bank has a relatively high tolerance for faster inflation at the moment and wants to allow the economy to run hot, creating lots of jobs, for a long period.\\n\\nWith the Fed focused on maximum employment creation, it is almost inevitable global supply chains and manufacturing systems will remain stretched, generating upward pressure on goods prices and raw materials.\\n\\nNot since the 1960s has the Fed been so intensely focused on employment, when there was strong growth in output, but which eventually ended with a sharp acceleration in inflation at the end of the decade and in the 1970s.\\n\\nFor the central bank, the hope is that running the economy hot will encourage investment in additional capacity in the manufacturing and commodities sectors, creating jobs and dampening price increases over time.\\n\\nThere is a fine line between running hot and overheating, and if the central bank ends up on the wrong side, there will eventually have to be painful interest rate increases to tackle it.\\n\\nIn the meantime, high levels of consumer and business spending are likely to keep most commodities in short supply through 2021 and 2022, keeping upward pressure on raw materials and manufacturing prices.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nUS Consumer PricesCommodity PricesTight SupplyUS Federal ReserveEconomyFederal Open Market CommitteeUS Bureau Of Economic AnalysisInflation\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

BJP will win 70 seats while its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) will suffer reverses and will settle for just eight seats. BJP in Assam had set a target of winning 100 plus seats for the assembly polls of 2021. Most exit polls have hinted at BJP retaining power in Assam. “BJP on its own will get a majority and will win 70 seats, while its ally AGP will win eight seats, United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) will win five seats,” Assam BJP president Ranjit Kumar Dass told media persons in Guwahati.\\n\\n“Together with allies, we will get 83 seats in the 126-member assembly. There are 21 seats which are doubtful, and we are expecting from these seats we will garner at least three seats and our tally will touch 86. In Barak valley we will get seven seats,” he said. There are 15 seats in Southern Assam’s Barak valley. In 2016, BJP had won eight seats, while All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) won four and Congress three seats.

Assam had a three-phase assembly poll and counting of ballots will take place on May 2. Congress cobbled up 10 parties led -Grand alliance (Mahajhot) to take on the BJP led alliance.

That was said by Maruti as well as Bajaj Auto NSE 0.22 %. It is going to remain a concern for some time to come despite what they may have delivered in quarterly numbers. How do you read into this commentary?\\nIf the commodity prices keep surging and staying there, then it is much easier to pass on because typically commodity prices account for 20-25% in an automobile. In a Rs 5-lakh Maruti car, if Rs 1 lakh is commodity price and even if it is subsidised by 20%, still 5-6% will be added to the sales price. Once it can be passed on, some margin sacrifice will be there but I do not see a 20% increase in the sales price.\\n\\nThe auto sector has gone through some crazy times in transitioning from BS IV to BS VI and on top of it, the 28% GST and now there is a slowdown. It is a very important manufacturing base. This year will not be a great year for autos broadly.\\n\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Tata Steel Ltd moved up by 1 in 6 months on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\nWhat about metals which have been wealth creators for investors? Yesterday, there was news that China will be removing that rebate of 13% VAT on steel exports from May 1. We have seen phenomenal gains across the board. Is it time for the commodity linked space to shine?\\nRight now they are shining like never before. So, I think there is a shortage of all kinds.\\n\\nNMDC, Tata Steel NSE 0.66 % are all rather active in today’s trading session.\\nThe capacity addition did not happen and the bumper demand for all kinds of durables had come back simultaneously. The low interest rates environment is also giving a chance. There is massive speculation in the commodities and demand is strong. It is all across. Plastics, steel, copper whatever is traded, is on fire. It is to do with the lot of liquidity sloshing around and demand being very strong after the Covid subsided in many parts of the world.\\n\\nOn the back of that, we have been talking about the cyclical theme versus defensives and the return possibility on cyclicals at a time like this. How would you be going about it?\\nIt is very challenging to manage large money which is shifting from one side to another. But we do whatever we can do with our understanding of things but one cannot sit not taking notice of the opportunities here.\\n\\nInfra is a pocket that you are still confident on given the fact that we are seeing a spending push on that front. Steel aside, will cement, infra and even real estate to some extent will continue to thrive?\\nSitting here, it looks like things are grim on the ground level, but other markets like China and the US are dollar priced. All the commodities are dollar priced and if there is a boom in China and in the US, obviously it will boom here also. That is happening and the difficult part is to fathom what it is. Is it a super cycle? Is it a temporary blip? It has gone up vertically and it can fall vertically. So, there are danger in commodities if there is a demand collapse in any part of the world. Right now. it is taken for granted that demand will surge. Till global monetary systems start tightening, we have at least one year upmove. The current trend is likely to strengthen and there is an opportunity.\\n\\nHow are you looking at capitalising on the new tech as well as strong digitisation play across the spectrum? Will it be via unlisted players? Are you looking at traditional IT plays or fintech players?\\nDigitisation is here to stay and is going to become a more important part of life. Twenty years ago, there was hardly any internet and today without internet, we cannot do anything. This is how the technology keeps becoming more and more important. Earlier tech used to be only a support function. Today if you do not have tech, howsoever good you are in your profession, I do not think you are going to make it.\\n\\nOne has to look for businesses suited for online kind of fulfilment. The capacity of financial system can be literally unlimited. If you are selling some physical goods, your capacity is limited to whatever is available. If you are selling cement, even by online you can only sell as much as you can produce. But in the case of financial services, the capacity is literally unlimited. As the volume goes up, the cost per unit goes down. The possibilities of digital economy is quite staggering and we have just about started.\\n\\nAs the digital companies in India gets listed, we are definitely going to see many companies coming in which are pure digital, 50% digital or 70% digital. The biggest thing is that people like us, who are not children of digital economy, have to improve our understanding of this particular way of thinking because digital economy, digital companies are not built for EPS and PE. They have a very different way of building businesses. Eventually they make money, there is a lot of free cash flow and that is what you value. But to start with, it could be very different and by the time you realise it is a good business, valuations get crazy. It will be difficult but we will try to learn the game and let us see whether we can really come on top of it.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nRaamdeo AgrawalCyclical ThemeCommoditiesEt NowStock MarketTata SteelBajaj AutoNMDCMotilal Oswal Financial Services\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

The polls started on March 27 and concluded on April 29.\\n\\nSingh has claimed that there is an \"indirect discrimination\" against the general public as fines are collected from them for violating COVID-19 norms, but no action is taken against politicians.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCovidElection CommissionDelhi High CourtMHAPandemicMinistry Of Home AffairsSecond Wave\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nM.L.GUPTA\\n119 days ago\\nThe Home Ministry and the M/o H&FW etc. should take action against producers/sellers of \"CORONA DAVAI\".

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place.\\nGetty Images\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\nRELATED\\nFinancial pitfalls NRIs should avoid while investing in India\\n3 approaches to equity investing\\nAuto, insurance good for investment in medium to long term: Kunj Bansal\\nBy Erin Lowry\\n\\nLook around and you’d see a digital-era gold rush. There’s hype about cryptocurrencies, NFTs and GameStop-gate, not to mention the continued rise of the stock market, which many are watching through their Robinhood apps. Although some people will amass wealth through these assets, there is another form of investing that’s piqued my interest as of late.\\n\\nIn researching different ways to build wealth, I was struck by the opportunities VC and angel investors have for not only generating returns but also shaping the future.\\n\\nThe average stock market investor is only picking from companies that are publicly traded. But VCs and angels who invest at earlier stages have the chance to help a company reach an exchange in the first place. They can fund ventures with innovative ideas that other investors might not see and back companies created by underrepresented founders in the startup world.\\n\\nIf you’re looking to help shape the future of an industry and our economy, as well as build wealth, investing in startups is an actionable — albeit highly volatile — way to achieve your goal.\\n\\nOne issue, however, is access. As is often the case in wealth building, it takes money to make money. Angel investors are generally required to be “accredited investors.” For decades, the threshold for being accredited in the U.S. meant you needed either a net worth of $1 million, excluding a primary residence, or an individual income of at least $200,000 in each of the two most recent years ($300,000 for those filing jointly). In December 2020, the SEC expanded the definition to allow “natural persons to qualify as accredited investors based on certain professional certifications, designations or credentials or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution, which the Commission may designate from time to time by order.”\\n\\nHowever, there is a discussion about whether the net worth and income requirements are too low for today’s climate. One angel told me she felt these were too low for those in expensive cities because one would need to invest more to be adequately diversified. She’d prefer to see $5 million as the net worth minimum.\\n\\nHere’s the rationale. A 2017 survey found the median investment by an American angel was $25,000 per round to a single company. Now, let’s say you need to invest in at least 10 companies to be a diversified angel investor. That’d be a quarter-of-a-million dollars, which could mean 25% of someone’s net worth. Considering the volatility of the investments, even when properly diversified, that’s entirely too much risk. The prevailing rule of thumb is to not have more than 5% of your portfolio in speculative investments.\\n\\nBut although it makes sense to ensure investors are property diversified, this cap is incredibly restrictive. Demanding a $5 million or even $1 million net worth effectively blocks people from what can be impactful wealth building opportunities.\\n\\nFortunately, things are changing. Much like fractional shares changed the ability to invest in stocks, technology is opening up more opportunities for individuals to take advantage of angel investing. Enter equity crowdfunding.\\n\\nPlenty of millennials are familiar with crowdfunding via platforms like GoFundMe or Kickstarter, where people ask for money to start a business or help with unexpected expenses, and funders donate without expecting any ownership in the project or repayment. Equity crowdfunding operates along a similar principle in that you pool your money with anonymous strangers on the Internet, but in this case it’s to fund a company.\\n\\nThe big difference is, you get an interest in the business. It’s akin to contributing to an index fund or fractional shares. You own a small slice of equity, depending on how much you invest.\\n\\nEquity crowdfunding comes in two common forms: accredited, which is defined the same way as above, and open-access regulated, which is open to anyone who can legally invest. Sites like Republic and WeFunder offer the regular, non-accredited investor (like me) a chance to give angel investing a try. The type of security can vary based on the startup. For example, Republic offers Crowd SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), Token Purchase Agreements for Blockchain-related projects and Crowd Simple Debt Agreements.\\n\\nWhen considering how much to invest, it’s critical to remember that this should only be a speculative part of anyone’s portfolio. Settle on an amount of money you’re comfortable losing to the cause of funding a company you believe should exist and to — let’s be honest — the hope of making some money as well.\\n\\nDon’t forget that you’re just as likely to lose significant money or see your stake diluted overtime. Stats on startup failures run the gamut, but an oft-quoted one is that 90% fail in the first three years. Even if you were to be optimistic and say 50% — that’s still good odds you’d lose your money.\\n\\nI think attempts to democratize angel investing through equity crowdfunding are worthwhile because they point to a world where it’s not only the wealthy determining which startups live or die based on who gets funding. This doesn’t mean early-stage investing is the right route for everyone or that it will yield more than dashed dreams of funding the next Google or Facebook or Uber. But it’s a compelling option if you want to put (a small percentage of) your money to work.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nAngel InvestingSecAngel InvestorsStock MarketGoogleCommissionGofundmeRobinhood\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Having a manager whose leadership style puts a strain on their daily life can be a challenge – especially in uncertain times such as this. Many of us have come across various types of dysfunctional bosses- the passive aggressive one who makes those unnecessary sarcastic comments and remarks in meetings of your work, the micro-manager who wants to haunt you at every step of the project and changes/corrects every step. The abusive/aggressive one, who screams loudly to express their thoughts about everything you do. Or the stalker manager who checks on your every move at work – even when you take that much needed coffee break. Here’s how you can deal with a demanding boss, and keep your job.\\n\\n- Calm your body to calm yourself. Your body is always a good place to start to acknowledge and build awareness of defences that might be up. Focus on your body and what’s happening within. It might be helpful to take 5 mindful breathes to be able to focus on what is inside and what is outside. Neuroscience tells us that embodied practice is where real and sustainable behavioural change occurs.\\n\\n- Make sure you have identified the difference between being a boss and being bossy. This means exercising authority is not the same as being overly authoritative. Someone needs to be the one in-charge, the one to make decisions, and to make sure work is done in a timely fashion. A good boss will see when their team needs direction and will provide it in a constructive way. A bossy boss will try to control the situation by demanding certain things to be done without taking into consideration the capacity of the employee.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\n- When struggling with unrealistic deadlines or expectations it is essential to bring your expertise, gauge the scenario and not dwell into insecurity that you can’t do it. And yet if it still feels unrealistic, review it regarding how much time and effort it would actually take from your experience and then find ways to communicate that. Try chunking a big project into small tasks so as to not get overwhelmed by the deadlines placed on you.\\n\\n- Evaluate your boss’s approach and style to understand if you’ll get a better response by behaving proactively or reactively. The way boss’s work could also be a management culture. Embodying the boss’s style helps to know what to expect and how to respond to it. You'll gain valuable insights into some of the ways you may be holding yourself back from being able to make greater contributions.\\n\\n-Build empathy. It would be very difficult to be empathetic in situations that feel like a dead-end. Try to understand what is leading your boss to be this way. It will definitely help you to see and understand things from their perspective. What is the boss’s outlook? What might he/she be dealing with in their role? What challenges do they have to face?\\n\\n- Feasible and realistic solutions tend to catch more attention and acknowledgements. Be receptive to the feedback that you receive but do not accept all the feedback. If you disagree, you can communicate authentically without being aggressive or disrespectful. Approach your boss in a calm, professional, and rational manner. Asking for feedback doesn’t necessarily mean it will be positive. So be open to the idea of critical feedback. Your success also depends on the delivery and timing of your discussion; make sure you listen and are mindful of how you respond.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDemanding BossCalmBossNeuroscienceMental HealthWork StressWork From Home\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT\",\n",

Those below 18 years would be most vulnerable,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“After each wave flattens, we have seen a resurgence in other countries too. It’ll take 90-120 days after the wave flattens for the virus resurgence,” said Dr CN Manjunath, head, Covid-19 expert committee and nodal officer for Covid testing in the state.\\n\\nCovid live updates\\n\\nKarnataka’s experience, and that of European countries, shows that the third wave will be definitely there and preparation to tackle it must be taken seriously, say experts. Covid-appropriate behaviour like mask usage, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowds and hand hygiene, apart from vaccination, must be given utmost priority, they say.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to Dr Manjunath, all precautionary measures, restrictions on gatherings, religious events, political rallies, local body elections and fairs must be continued till December 2021. “The severity will be more in unvaccinated persons. The need is to speed up vaccination,” he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe agreed with Dr Sudarshan that children would be more vulnerable. “There are trials of Pfizer vaccines on children. By then, we may get vaccines for children too,” he said.\\n\\nAccording to Dr KR Bharath Kumar Reddy, paediatric pulmonologist and director, Shishuka Children’s Specialty Hospital, children would be vulnerable because of lack of vaccination. “However, the virus transmission chain may break as adults at home would be vaccinated and they may not spread to kids. Currently, in most cases, adults are transmitting to children who are not going to schools,” Dr Reddy said.\\n\\nUnless those in the 18-44 years category are vaccinated by October, a high number of cases will be seen among them too, experts said.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nResurgenceCovidChildrenKarnatakaTechnical Advisory CommitteeTACThird WaveVaccination\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n6 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nvaradharajan balasubramanian\\n119 days ago\\nyoung people should know this virus can adopt itself to changing situations.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThe rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations.\\nGetty Images\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years.\\nRELATED\\nPhysical gold in India swings to discount as pandemic stalls demand\\nView: Inflation-tolerant Fed will boost commodity prices\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nCOMMODITY SUMMARY\\nMCX\\nCOPPER\\nBy Eddie Spence and Megan Durisin\\n\\nThe prices of raw materials used to make almost everything are skyrocketing, and the upward trajectory looks set to continue as the world economy roars back to life.\\n\\nFrom steel and copper to corn and lumber, commodities started 2021 with a bang, surging to levels not seen for years. The rally threatens to raise the cost of goods from the lunchtime sandwich to gleaming skyscrapers. It’s also lit the fuse on the massive reflation trade that’s gripped markets this year and pushed up inflation expectations. With the U.S. economy pumped up on fiscal stimulus, and Europe’s economy starting to reopen as its vaccination rollout gets into gear, there’s little reason to expect a change in direction.\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. said this week it sees a continued rally in commodities and that the “reflation and reopening trade will continue.” On top of that, the Federal Reserve and other central banks seem calm about inflation, meaning economies could be left to run hot, which will rev up demand even more.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\n“The most important drivers supporting commodity prices are the global economic recovery and acceleration in the reopening phase,” said Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Group AG. The bank expects commodities as a whole to rise about 10% in the next year.\\n\\nChina, a crucial source of supply and demand for raw materials, is playing a big role, particularly as the government tries to reduce production of key metals like steel and aluminum. It’s also buying up massive amounts of grains. Food prices are also being affected as poor weather in key growing nations like Brazil and France hits harvests.\\n\\nAs just about every basic material gets rapidly more expensive, here’s some ways the rally is rippling across the globe to create winners and losers.\\n\\nGoing Green\\nCopper has enjoyed an unstoppable rally for more than a year thanks to pledges by governments to boost renewable energy and electric vehicle use. That’ll make all the various forms of green technology that rely on it a bit more expensive.\\n\\nBigger power grids is one such case. About 1.9 million tons of copper was used to build electricity networks in 2020, according to BloombergNEF, and the price of the red metal is up more than 90% in the past year. Usage will almost double by 2050, BNEF forecasts, while demand from other low carbon technologies like electric vehicles and solar panels will also balloon.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBuyers and Sellers\\nFor countries, the impact of the commodity rally depends on whether they’re an exporter or importer. For those relying heavily on exporting raw materials, the huge upswings can only be good news for public finances, especially when they’ve just been stricken by a once-in-a-century pandemic. The likes of Australia (iron ore), Chile (copper) and Indonesia (palm oil) all make huge sums from commodities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, countries looking to rebuild infrastructure may find their budgets buy less than they used to. President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion plan is one such case. Electricity grids, railways and refurbishing buildings are among the items on the shopping list that will use large amounts of metal.\\n\\nConsultancy CRU Group estimates the program will add 5 million tons of steel to the 80 million the U.S. uses each year, with similar boosts to aluminum and copper demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nMeat\\nIt’s been a tough year to be in the meat business, from devastating Covid outbreaks to the deadly pig disease that hit Germany and is roaring back in China.\\n\\nAnd as crop prices surge, farmers rearing poultry, pigs and cattle are among the first to get squeezed by the eye-watering run-up in grains. Costs for corn fed to livestock have doubled in the past year, and soybean meal is more than 40% higher. While there’s a delay before that hits the burger chain or steakhouse, there are already signs of prices creeping higher.\\n\\nOld Steel Mills\\nSteel producers in Europe and America have suffered for years from low prices caused by global overcapacity. Plants struggled to make money and job security became a growing worry. Over 85,000 steel jobs were lost in the European Union between 2008 and 2019, according to industry association Eurofer.\\n\\nThat’s all changed dramatically thanks to booming steel prices. Futures in China, by far the biggest producer, have smashed records — even outpacing gains in key ingredient iron ore — as the government took measures to curb output. That’s supercharged rallies of benchmark prices in Europe and America, where mills were already running at maximum capacity as they try to meet unexpectedly high demand.\\n\\nBloomberg\\n\\nBreakfast Tables\\nWhether you prefer latte or espresso, sweetened or plain, the key ingredients of a cup of coffee have surged. Arabica coffee futures have risen about 33% in the past year, while raw sugar has also advanced. Fancy a slice of toast? Benchmark wheat prices have hit the highest since 2013.\\n\\nOf course, rising commodities don’t immediately show up on grocery shelves and cafe menus. They make up just a part of the costs for retailers, which often absorb the initial increase to keep customers coming back. But there’s a limit to that margin hit, and high prices could ultimately feed through to consumers.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSteelLumberCornUBS Group AGEuropean UnionCopperCommoditiesFederal Reserve\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Shares of the video game retailer and many other meme stocks that rallied in its wake are well off their highs, and retail trading has dropped from levels seen earlier in the year.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing some return of interest to those Reddit-type stocks but not with the same pace and fervor we saw before,\" said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management.\\n\\nStill, some market-watchers believe a smaller-scale face-off between retail investors and short sellers may have sparked part of the volatility in MicroVision and other recent movers.\\n\\nAverage short interest in a basket of 50 stocks with market capitalization of under $100 billion monitored by Vanda Research has climbed to levels last seen in January, the firm said in a report earlier this week.\\n\\nAt the same time, cash equity purchases and the premium spent on call options for MicroVision and some of the other gainers soared in recent weeks, an indicator of retail buying, according to analysts at Vanda, which tracks retail activity.\\n\\n\"With the precedent of Melvin Capital in mind, we suspect that the long/short community started to trim bearish bets as soon as they sniffed a potential comeback from the Reddit crowd,\" Vanda’s analysts wrote.\\n\\nMicroVision, which traded below $1 as recently as June 2020, is up 210% since short seller Hindenburg Research said it was betting against the company’s stock on Dec. 22, illustrating the potential dangers bearish investors face when positioning against meme stocks. Hindenburg Research did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\n“Right now you can have a perfectly logical reason to short a stock and still take a terrible beating if a group of small traders pull together to push the stock in the other direction,\" said Phipps.\\n\\nWATCHING WSB\\nCarson Block, founder of short seller Muddy Waters Research, said he keeps a keen eye on online chatter and forums such as WallStreetBets, where users often attempt to coordinate their buying in stocks they believe are short-squeeze candidates.\\n\\n“We are now watching closely,” said Block.\\n\\nBlock said he is now more focused on technical aspects such as companies where a high percentage of stock is owned by insiders and institutional investors that are unlikely to sell the shares.\\n\\nWhether the stars will align anytime soon for another move on the scale of GameStop\\'s remains to be seen. That stock had a combination of short interest that peaked at about 145% of the float, according to S3 Partners data, a massive following among retail investors and institutions happy to jump in on the shares\\' wild ride.\\n\\nInvestors are “looking for history possibly to repeat or looking for stocks that are going to go parabolic,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. However, “GameStop was such an outlier in price moves that (it) is difficult for that to happen again.”\\n\\nThere are signs, however, that broader trading activity among retail investors may be picking up.\\n\\nIn the latest week, there was $700 million in net retail buying of large-cap companies tracked by JPMorgan, compared with $500 million in the previous period, the bank said in a report issued on Wednesday.\\n\\nVanda Research said purchases of single stocks by retail investors have ticked higher, though they remain much lower than in previous months. Meanwhile, buying of exchange-traded funds by retail investors fell earlier in the week to its lowest levels since late last year, a potential sign they may be ready to take on more risk, the firm said.\\n\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nMeme StocksS3 PartnersJPMorganWallstreet BetsVideo Game Retailer Gamestop CorpPhippsMelvin CapitalGameStop CorpStocks\\n(What\\'s moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

Household size was an important explanatory factor for the disparity for COVID-19 mortality in South Asian groups only.\\n\\nDr Mathur said: \"While multigenerational living may increase risk of exposure and transmission (from children or working age adults to older or vulnerable family members), such households and extended communities also offer valuable informal care networks and facilitate engagement with health and community services.\\n\\n\"In light of emerging evidence that minority ethnic groups are less likely to take up the COVID-19 vaccine, co-designing culturally competent and non-stigmatising engagement strategies with these communities is increasingly important.\"\\n\\nOn behalf of NHS England, the research team used the new secure OpenSAFELY data analytics platform to analyse partially anonymised electronic health data collected by general practitioners (GPs) covering 40 per cent of England.\\n\\nThese GP records were linked to other national coronavirus-related data sets for the first and second waves of the pandemic - including testing, hospital data and mortality records. Ethnicity was self-reported by participants in GP records and grouped into five census categories (white, South Asian, Black, other, mixed) and then a further 16 sub-groups.\\n\\n\"Minority ethnic groups in the UK are disproportionately affected by factors that also increase the risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes, such as living in deprived areas, working in front-line jobs, and having poorer access to healthcare,\" notes Dr Mathur.\\n\\n\"Our study indicates that even after accounting for many of these factors, the risk for testing positive, hospitalisation, ICU admission and death was still higher in minority ethnic groups compared with white people in England.\\n\\n\"To improve COVID-19 outcomes, we urgently need to tackle the wider disadvantage and structural racism faced by these communities, as well as improving access to care and reducing transmission,\" she said.\\n\\nThe authors caution that there are some limitations to the study including an inability to capture all potential explanatory variables, including occupation, health-related behaviours, and experiences of racism or structural discrimination.\\n\\nThey call for improving the completeness of ethnicity recording in health data to further support the conduct of high-quality research into addressing health inequalities for COVID-19 and beyond.\\n\\nThe study, believed to be the largest of its type, was funded by the UK\\'s Medical Research Council and conducted by scientists from a group of universities including LSHTM and the University of Oxford, along with the National Institute of Health Research.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nTesting PositiveCovidNHS EnglandLondon School Of Hygiene & Tropical MedicineCoronavirusMinority Ethnic GroupsLancetUniversity Of Oxford\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nBank of Baroda, RBL and IDFC First could double from here: Sanjiv Bhasin\\nGame not over in pharma, chemicals: Pashupati Advani\\nIf you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now, says Naveen Kulkarni, CIO, Axis Securities Ltd.\\n\\n2020 was all about Reliance and those big deals that we saw for Jio and retail. What will be the next picture for RIL NSE -0.14 %? That’s what the markets would want to know.\\nIf you look at Reliance Industries, the stock did pretty well till October or so. November onwards, the stock started cooling off and from highs closer to Rs 2,300, the stock has been hovering between Rs 1,800-2,200. The stock has corrected and there has been some bit of derating also that has happened.\\n\\nBut having said that, the critical aspect is how the overall industry cycle is going to pan out. If the O2C segment starts doing better, then I think there is a play because the stock has been an underperformer for the last four to five months. The important aspect that we need to see is how sustainable these trends are going to be. The current quarter numbers look quite encouraging. If the trend continues to be an upcycle, there is much scope for the stock to do well just based on the operating performance.\\nDID YOU KNOW?\\nStock score of Reliance Industries Ltd moved up by 1 in a week on a 10-point scale.\\nVIEW LATEST STOCK REPORT\\n »\\n\\nAs far as other triggers are concerned, the Aramco deal is pretty much one aspect that we could be looking at. Apart from that, if the retail business or digital services business gets listed on foreign bourses, those could be the trigger. It could be the long-term trigger but from an operating performance perspective, the O2C segment is going to be very critical. We already know how the Jio platform business is panning out. The long-term growth trajectory is understood and valuations are in place. Other businesses are where they see more value to be created, especially the O2C segment.\\n\\nWould it make sense for Reliance shareholders to hold a stake in Aramco and give up stake in O2C? Will the deal be as attractive as a plain cash for stake deal?\\nIt is difficult to make a case for that at this point in time. It remains to be seen how a pure share swap deal will enthuse the investors. Cash has also its own advantages as well as disadvantages. But we will have to wait and watch out what exactly is on offer. Also, an important factor will be what it could mean in terms of controlling stake and how the company is going to be run. Those will be the critical aspects that one will have to watch out for. It is difficult to gauge the benefits at this point in time. But it might be a very interesting thing to look at. We have not had something like this in India as far as I can remember. So that will be something that we all will be looking forward to.\\n\\nWould we see Reliance Industries’ three main businesses being hived off into three different divisions? Is that something all of you in the markets and the analysts community are still following up?\\nMore important aspect will be how the holding structure will pan out once the business is structured. There are a lot of moving parts here. One is to look at that sum of the parts and say that the value of the sum of the parts is probably higher than what the market is ascribing to in terms of numbers. But the important aspect would be how the structuring will actually happen and more importantly, how the businesses will be run after that.\\n\\nIt is like two to three steps ahead of what we are able to analyse at this point in time in terms of the sum of parts valuation. So it remains to be seen. If you look at typically how Reliance is valued at the sum of the parts, valuation will definitely offer a much higher value than what it is right now. But the challenge has been that it is difficult to envisage how the structure of the company will evolve post that and that is why the market is ascribing the value to what the sum of the parts valuation entails. So we will have to wait and watch out how that happens, but as far as the analyst community is concerned, the sum of the parts valuation for these three businesses are very much considered and that is the way that company is being valued now.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nSegment PicksJioReliance IndustriesAramcoRilNaveen KulkarniRill O2C Business\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

As many as 15,523 people have died since the outbreak of the pandemic last year.\\n\\nCiting Maharashtra where a 44-day lockdown brought the infection under control to a good extent, Sudhakar appealed to the people to follow the regulations instead of loitering around unnecessarily.\\n\\nTo a question on the vaccination drive for people above 18 years of age, which could not take off fully from May 1 as was announced by the Central government, he said adequate stock of vaccine did not arrive due to which the drive was started symbolically by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa with the available stock of three lakh vaccines.\\n\\n\"We have a stock of vaccines, which is not huge to meet the requirement. We will inform people once the vaccines arrive in the State,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Health Minister said the State government has set a target to vaccinate everyone.\\n\\nTo a question on shortage of drugs and oxygen, he said there is unnecessary panic among people who are hoarding Remdesivir vials and oxygen fearing that they would not get in case of an emergency. According to him, at least 85 per cent of the infected people remain asymptomatic whereas only five to eight per cent show moderate symptoms.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nDr K SudhakarKarnatakaLockdownHealth Minister\\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\nADD COMMENT',\n",

       " \"Synopsis\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports.\\nGetty Images\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level.\\nRELATED\\nSelloff shows market to remain shackled by Covid fears for now\\nDIIs emerge smart buyers as bulls & bears play tug of war\\nForeign investors bet on economy rebound as they look beyond India's Covid-19 crisis\\nNifty’s trading range remained wider than usual during the week gone by, but it took a serious cut on Friday’s session. Despite that, the index managed to close the week on a positive note. In the previous weekly note, we had mentioned that Nifty was trading inside the Falling Channel that it had created, and any decisive move above the 15,000 mark would offer cues about the market’s upward move.\\n\\nHowever, the index has failed to move past that point and stayed inside the channel. Following a rangebound week, the headline index finally ended with a net gain of 289 points (+2.02%) on a weekly basis.\\n\\nIn the week before this one, Nifty had violated an important pattern support that comes in the form of a Rising Trend Line drawn from the lows of March 2020. Despite the violation of this pattern support, Nifty averted weakness this time by managing to hang around precariously near this trend line.\\n\\nVolatility has risen and INDIA VIX has grown marginally by 1.49% to 23.0300 level. For the coming week and beyond, it would be crucially important for the 50-pack to stay above this trend line, and any failure to do so will increase the possibility of violation of the Falling Channel that the Nifty is in. This can also invite incremental weakness in the market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty is likely to start the coming week on a soft note and the 14,730 and 14,900 levels are likely to act as key resistance, while the 14,500 and 14,350 levels are likely to offer supports. In the event of any corrective move, this trading range is likely to widen. The weekly RSI stands at 58.86; it stays neutral and does not show any divergence against the price. The weekly MACD remains bearish and stays below the Signal Line.\\n\\nA Shooting Star formation has emerged on the candles. Such a formation would occur when the price shows a gapup start, trends higher, but closes much lower being unable to sustain the gains.\\n\\nSince such a candle has emerged near a pattern resistance level, it can have bearish implications. However, as always, this would require confirmation on the next bar. Pattern analysis showed Nifty is inside a channel that it has formed; and it has not been able to break out of this channel and is clinging on to an important pattern support of a trend line that begins from March 2020 lows and joins the subsequent higher bottoms.\\n\\nAll in all, Nifty is within a corrective retracement following the formation of the high point at 15,431 level. While the market is in seeing such a retracement, the out-of-control Covid situation in the country is hitting investor sentiment hard. There is a clear shift in preference towards the traditionally defensive stocks.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nWe recommend staying highly stock-specific and keeping fresh purchases limited to low-beta and defensive stocks. All rallies should be used more for taking some money off the table rather than making fresh purchases. While keeping the overall exposures at a modest level, a highly cautious outlook is advised for the coming week.\\n\\nIn our look at Relative Rotation Graphs®, we compared various sectoral indices against CNX500 (Nifty500 Index), which represents over 95% of the free-float market-cap of all the listed stocks.\\n\\nTJE review of RRG showed only Metal, Midcap100 and the Commodity Indices are showing steady relative momentum while being placed inside the leading quadrant. Energy, Infrastructure and PSE Indices are inside the leading quadrant, but they all appear to be losing their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nET CONTRIBUTORS\\n\\nNifty PSU Bank, Realty and Nifty Bank Indices are all inside the weakening quadrant. All of them appear to be rotating south-west and giving up their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to relatively underperform the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Financial Services index has rolled inside the lagging quadrant, while the Auto Index is languishing inside this quadrant. Nifty IT and Media indices are also inside this quadrant, but they were seen improving their relative momentum against the broader market.\\n\\nNifty Consumption Index has just rolled inside the improving quadrant. It joins Nifty Pharma and FMCG indices, which are also inside the improving quadrant. They appear to be steadily maintaining their relative momentum against the broader market. They are likely to show a resilient performance and relatively outperform the broader market.\\n\\nImportant Note: RRGTM charts show the relative strength and momentum for a group of stocks. In the above chart, they show relative performance against the Nifty500 Index (broader market) and should not be used directly as buy or sell signals.\\n\\n(Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA is a Consultant Technical Analyst and founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services, Vadodara.

       " \"Synopsis\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\nAgencies\\nRepresentative Image\\nIndia is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic. On April 25, 2021, we reported over 3.5 lakh cases of fresh infections from the coronavirus. This was the highest ever single day account since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Apart from the steep surge in the rate of infections, another pressing concern is the rising fatality rate. Onwards April 19, 2021, we have been losing over 2000 lives daily to the virus.\\n\\nThere are no two opinions that the way out of the pandemic still remains the same – express vaccination till we achieve herd immunity. Israel has already done it and the US, UK and Russia are well on the way to achieving the same.\\n\\nIndia’s Vaccination Plan\\nThe first phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive kicked off on January 16, 2021. It aimed to inoculate 30 crores of people by July 2021 with a target of 70 lakh doses administered daily. In line with WHO’s recommendations, the beneficiaries of the first phase were healthcare and frontline workers. Subsequently, the second phase of the inoculation drive saw the net being widened. People over the age of 60, or people over the age of 45 with co-morbidities, were eligible beneficiaries. On April 1, 2021, the second phase was extended to people of 45 years and above. The third phase of the vaccination would be set in motion from May 1, 2021. It will provide access to vaccines for people in the age group of 18-45 years of age.\\n\\nThe National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration opted for the distribution of the vaccines as per age groups. This made sense as the fatalities recorded in people over the age of 60 and people with co-morbidities were significantly higher. However, the slow rate of vaccination at 8.7 % of the total population in 90 days compared to 36.3 % in the US and 32.3 % in the UK is proving to be counter-intuitive of this theory. The sluggishness is partly due to the initial vaccine hesitancy followed soon after by huge vaccine shortage. May be this was one reason for PM Modi to exhort the nation into celebration of 'Tika Utsav' vaccination festival from April 11 to April 14. However, the doses administered during the Tika Utsav fell due to supply constraints.\\n\\nVaccine shortage\\nBetween April 1 and April 2021, on an average 36 lakh doses were administered across the country. But, during the Tika Utsav, on an average only 32 lakh doses were administered. As many as 900 inoculation centres (65 %) were closed all over Odisha because of unavailability of vaccines. Odisha was only provided one-tenth of its demand for 25 lakh vaccines for 10 days for the Tika Utsav, despite the state achieving negative vaccine wastage. Average vaccinations have shrunk from 32 lakhs during the Tika Utsav to just about 25 lakhs between April 15 and April 26. Whereas a record low of 9 lakh vaccinations took place on April 25, the day the country recorded its highest ever daily cases of fresh infections.\\n\\nThis problem is likely to get accentuated in phase 3 of the vaccination process due to acute shortage in manufacture and supply of vaccines. Odisha, for example, does not expect its vaccination to start before May 15 for Covaxin and end of May for Covishield.\\n\\nUnlike other countries which boldly stockpiled corona virus vaccines even when they were undergoing clinical trials, India probably played inexplicably safe. We continued to put ad hoc orders and did not strengthen the production line of Bharat Biotech (BB) (producer of Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (SII) (producer of Covishield) until recently. Maybe we assumed that there would not be a second wave.\\n\\nBurden on the States\\nAdded to the above, the higher price of both the vaccines for states has put them under enormous fiscal burden. In the third phase, beginning May 1, cumulatively about 60 crores of population (aged between 18-45 years) would be eligible for vaccination in various states whereas the national age-wise distribution of population over the age of 45 accounts for only about 34 crores. This implies that there is a disproportionate fiscal pressure on the states most of whom have understandably already declared universal free vaccinations. This is further aggravated manifold by a higher pricing (Rs.400-Rs.600) of both the vaccine types for the states compared to the Centre (Rs.150 per dose) even while all earlier universal immunization efforts in India have been Central schemes with a pre-determined sharing pattern between Centre and states to keep the implementation simple.\\n\\nThe states could have harnessed this money towards strengthening the already noticeable inadequate infrastructure in the district and sub-district hospitals, preparing for a possible third wave. Additionally, the higher price of Covaxin and Covishield for private hospitals would crowd out the private sector and their infrastructure and manpower from this national effort as people would throng government centres for free shots, thus putting enormous pressure on the existing fragile government–run vaccination centres.\\n\\nWay Forward\\nVaccinate and vaccinate fast. This is the best-fit solution. Along with Covid appropriate behaviour, an expedited vaccination drive is the need of the hour to break the chain of transmission. Currently, we have only vaccinated about 10 persons per capita while Brazil and China have vaccinated 18 and 16 persons per capita. At present, the centre should enforce immediate compulsory licensing under Patent Act for both the manufacturers while simultaneously approving a greater number of manufactures and vaccine types to preclude possibilities of cartelisation and profiteering. This would allow other manufacturers without infringing on intellectual property. Additionally, India should continue to advocate for relaxation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) given the global health emergency to quickly ramp up production of vaccines.\\n\\n(The author is Member of Rajya Sabha of Biju Janata Dal (BJD) from Odisha.

       " \"Synopsis\\n‘The year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses’\\nETMarkets.com\\nGoing forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors.\\nRELATED\\nAt least one year’s up move left in commodities: Raamdeo Agrawal\\nRIL stock may rally if O2C segment picks up: Naveen Kulkarni\\nPharma, chemicals, speciality chemicals game not over; look at infra too: Pashupati Advani\\nThe margin trends of consumer companies will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost, says Mahantesh Sabarad, Head, Retail Research, SBICAP Securities.\\n\\nWhat is the stance that you will be taking on banks going forward? Is it the lending services where one needs to have a larger exposure or should one focus on corporate-facing banks or retail-oriented ones? Where should one actually hold positions?\\nThe results of most of the banks were slightly disappointing to begin with. I was quite surprised when most of these banks started going up this week. They had indeed moderated over the last one day but overall, the week has been good for the banks. The results were quite bad for most of the banks because if you look at the NPA trend and really focus on the quality of the earnings that have been reported, the proforma invoices are pretty large for most of the banks. You can clearly make out the distinction between two sets of banks; banks that have made good amounts of provisions versus banks that have not made good amounts of provisions. They are also struggling with their capitalisation ratio, i.e., the tier one capitalisation.\\n\\nIf you distinguish these parameters, you will notice that the year ahead for most of the banks is going to be a little tougher because the pro forma invoices at the end of the day will clearly result in some kind of losses to be borne with as we go forward.\\n\\nAs it is, we have now this vicious second wave of Covid coming in and that is going to create a whole lot of problems for the banking sector. Going forward, most of the banks will see tepid responses from the investors and if you ask me frankly, the markets are going to get a little jittery as we close out the May month.\\n\\nHow are you looking at some of the consumption companies that have come out with their earnings? Given the kind of commentary they have given in terms of the volume growth and given the current environment, what is it that you are expecting in terms of trends from consumers?\\nConsumer companies have reported good earnings and most of them actually have reported margins against the fear that commodity costs were going up. The margin trends have been quite good. Volume growth, of course, has been in double digits and that is what was expected from most of the consumer companies. We also know that the logistics are unaffected due to government’s lockdown measures.\\n\\nGiven this situation, for most of the consumer companies who are dependent on logistics companies, there is a lot of e-commerce kind of distribution happening. There are also a lot of digitisation moves that we are seeing. We will encourage most of the FMCG companies to maintain their growth trends ahead.\\n\\nHowever, I still believe that the margin trends will weaken in the first quarter because there now seems to be a lag effect of the commodity cost push that we had seen come into their earnings in the first quarter. So again, going forward it will be a little bit negative for FMCG companies. The margin trends will be weaker. But the only good point that we should acknowledge here is most of them should be looking at better volume growth as we move ahead.\\n\\nWhat is your outlook on the entire infrastructure/capital goods space? What is it that you are factoring in by way of the execution of the ordering trends in light of the second wave?\\nMost of the infrastructure project activities are subdued as you have labour shortages. You even have material shortages coming in certain places and order intake has been quite weak. Most of the orders that you are seeing are driven by government orders, which are pending for several months and therefore being expedited now. There is no fresh capex intent that we are seeing in a big manner and therefore, the overall capital goods and infrastructure space is going to be a little weaker.\\n\\nAlso, remember that the inflation is perking up a little bit and we sense that somewhere, the RBI will have to step in either with the rate increase or an outlook that tries to tighten the overall money supply situation so that inflation is in a way reined in. Any rise in inflation and thereby rise in interest rates does not augur really well for most of the infrastructure companies or most of the capital goods companies. So the outlook remains quite weak for the capital goods companies.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nCapital Goods StocksMargin TrendsRBIFmcgInfrastructure StocksGood EarningsConsumer CompaniesNPAMahantesh Sabarad\\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips and expert advice on ETMarkets.

       " 'Synopsis\\nThis time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up.\\niStock\\nSkinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over.\\nRELATED\\nHow e-commerce has changed shopping rules in the pandemic\\nThese robots are helping residents of Singapore with grocery shopping\\nCovid19 second wave-led local restrictions, curfews halve malls, shopping centres’ revenue\\nWomen are saying yes to the dress. The garment has become one emblem of the post-lockdown consumer, as economies slowly reopen in places like the U.S. and U.K.\\n\\nAnd dressier clothing is just the start of what may be a “great rotation” in consumer spending. At the end of last year, we argued that a vaccine-driven economic recovery would shift what people buy — they’d order less leisure wear and buy fewer cushions, but put more money toward champagne, suits and experiences. In categories like fashion and cosmetics, this shift is indeed happening; however, other areas like dining, travel and big events have yet to really get going.\\n\\nUntil trips to offices and sunny climes pick up again, retailers and manufacturers will have to manage this sputtering recovery and deal with levels of demand that may be much more, or much less, than they expected.\\n\\nUrban Outfitters Inc. was the first to signal the return to dressing up. It said that at its Anthropologie brand in the last week of February, seven of its 10 best-selling online items were dresses. Over the previous year, one or two dresses at most would have made the top 10.\\n\\nWhen British retail reopened in June and December 2020, shoppers bought many of the same things they were ordering in lockdown — lots of leisurewear and lingerie. This time around, sales of womenswear — and particularly floaty, mid-length dresses — are up, as are handbags and mascara (yes to above-the-mask makeup). There’s far less interest in comfortable clothes made for lounging at home.\\n\\n“Fashion is back,” declared Associated British Foods Plc, the owner of budget chain Primark. Clothing is undergoing its own metamorphosis: Skinny jeans, the workhorse of women’s wardrobes for more than a decade, are on their way out; mom jeans and other looser-cut pants are taking over. This is boosting denim sales, and should inspire sales of new tops and shoes to go with them.\\n\\nPutting on the Glitz\\nA return to office life will also fuel more fashion spending. Winser London, which specializes in stylish workwear for women, is seeing demand for more fitted dresses increase as cities open up again. Menswear hasn’t picked up as much, but sales should revive as employers call workers back to headquarters.\\n\\nSmarten Up\\nWhile the rotation in clothing appears well underway, the picture is more complicated in other consumer sectors. In food, for example, restaurants are getting busier, but people are still cooking and ordering a lot at home.\\n\\nNestle SA says it’s seeing demand recover for products used in restaurants, especially in China; at the same time, its Nespresso coffee unit is still benefiting from remote workers being their own baristas. Rekki, a technology platform that connects independent restaurants with food suppliers, has also seen orders rise as the hospitality sector comes back.\\n\\niStock\\n\\n\\nStarbucks Corp. is starting to see recovery in sales at U.S. shops in dense, urban areas — the type that rely on office workers and tourists. But growth in its home market in the latest quarter was still powered by suburban locations and drive-thru windows, a sign that pandemic routines haven’t yet faded.\\n\\nEat Up\\nThe home improvement category hasn’t changed much yet, but spending on renovations and other projects is expected to slow over time. Now that you’ve built a new shed and extended that loft, you probably won’t be repeating the process anytime soon. Some makeover projects envisioned in lockdown are still underway or awaiting an available contractor, but there will likely be fewer starting as vacations and sports tickets reclaim wallet share.\\n\\nHolidays typically take a large chunk of the family budget. Right now, there’s a lot of uncertainty over international travel and fewer tourists are booking vacations abroad in sunny destinations such as Greece and Spain. (No wonder demand for swimwear is lagging fashion.) But if travel to and around Europe does resume this summer, it will unleash a torrent of spending. Unilever Plc says the performance of its European ice-cream business would be linked to whether people can visit beaches and tourist towns.\\n\\nBeing in the midst of these shifts means retailers and consumer goods groups must keep planning for uncertainty and remain flexible. Strategies will have to take into account the vastly different Covid experiences across regions. In the U.S. and Europe, for example, clothing and food retailers should be ready to increase their supply. In markets still ravaged by the virus, such as India, the emphasis will be on meeting the needs of people who need to isolate, stay at home and recover from the virus.\\n\\nAs the great post-pandemic shift in consumer habits inches along, the old adage that “retail is detail” has never been more appropriate.\\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\\nNestle SAPandemic ShoppingNespressoUnilever PlcPandemic FashionStarbucks Corp.\\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily Market Updates & Live Business News.\\n1 COMMENTS ON THIS STORY\\nRamesh Shah\\n119 days ago\\nIN INDIA ITS OUT OF SHEER FRUSTRATIONS..\\nVIEW COMMENTS ADD COMMENTS']"
